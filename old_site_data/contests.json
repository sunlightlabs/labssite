   "body": "### What it Is\r\n\r\nApps for America is a special contest we're putting on this year to celebrate the release of [Data.gov](http://data.gov)! We're doing it alongside [Google](http://google.com), [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com), and [TechWeb](http://techweb.com) and the winners will be announced at the [Gov 2.0 Expo Showcase](http://gov2expo.com) in Washington, DC at the end of the Summer.\r\n\r\n### Why we're doing it\r\n\r\nJust as the federal government begins to provide data in Web developer-friendly formats, we're organizing Apps for America 2: The Data.gov Challenge to demonstrate that when government makes data available, it makes itself more accountable and creates more trust and opportunity in its actions. The contest submissions will also show the creativity of developers in designing compelling applications that provide easy access and understanding for the public, while also showing how open data can save the government tens of millions of dollars by engaging the development community in application development at far cheaper rates than traditional government contractors.  \r\n### How to Compete\r\n\r\n1. Contestants must join the [Sunlight Labs Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/sunlightlabs).\r\n\r\n2. Entries must be applications that use at least one of the data sources or content from [Data.gov](http://data.gov).\r\n\r\n3. Entries can be client applications, web based applications, applications that use the Adobe AIR platform, iPhone apps, Java applications or whatever other kind of platform you'd like to write it in. We use [Django](http://djangoproject.org) or [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for most of ours. There's a caveat here though: judges have to be able to *judge* the application. Which means building something on an esoteric platform or something that requires lots of strange libraries in order to run won't get easily judged and won't get a very good score as a consequence. So make sure your application is easy for judges to judge when making a platform selection. This means there's a strong preference for web based tools.\r\n\r\n4. While not required, bonus points go to using one of Sunlight's [open source libraries](/projects/), APIs or APIs and libraries of our partners like [maplight](http://maplight.org), [opensecrets](http://www.opensecrets.org), and [followthemoney.org](http://www.followthemoney.org)!\r\n\t\r\n5. All software you write has to be licensed under [any OSI approved license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)\r\n\r\n6. If you are a candidate, 527 or party committee or other organization that a non-profit cannot give money to, you are not eligible. Your staff is welcome to compete as individuals though. Also ineligible: staff of the Sunlight Foundation.\r\n\r\n7. You can team up however you want. If you win the big prize, we'll work with you to split the money to your specifications within reason. (e.g. if you are a team of 10,000 developers, we're not sending 10,000 $1 checks)\r\n\r\n### Criteria\r\n\r\nAwards will be judged based on the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Transparency: Does the app help citizens see things they couldn't see before the app existed?\r\n\r\n2. Permanence: Will the app be usable over a long period of time? Does the idea have survivability?\r\n\r\n3. Design & Visualization: Does the app look great? Does the app visualize data in a new and interesting way?\r\n\r\n### Prizes:\r\n\r\n* First Place (1): $10,000\r\n\r\n* Second Place (1): $5,000\r\n\r\n* Third Place (1): $2,500\r\n\r\n* Honorable Mention (10): $500\r\n\r\n* Super bonus visualization prize: We'll be giving out a $2500 prize to the entrant that has the best visualization of the data on data.gov that may be given in addition to the prizes mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThis year, the first, second and third prize winners (and the visualization prize winner, if that is not one of the first, second or third place winners) will also receive airfare and hotel placement for a trip to Washington, DC. While in Washington, DC, they'll attend our awards ceremony at the Gov 2.0 Expo Showcase by O'Reilly Media and TechWeb. They'll get a chance to demo their applications both at the Awards Ceremony, as well as at a table with the other winners during the convention.\r\n\r\nAn individual can have as many entries as they'd like, and an individual can win one prize per entry they provide, however, one entry cannot win more than one prize other than the super bonus visualization prize.\r\n\r\n### Judges:\r\n* Tim O'Reilly - Founder, O'Reilly Media\r\n* Chris DiBona - Open Source Program Manager, Google\r\n* Clay Johnson - Director, Sunlight Labs\r\n* Judge 4 - TBD\r\n* Judge 5 - TBD\r\n\r\nSorry, but we don't have all the judges yet. We'll let you know who the remaining judges are once we have them committed.\r\n\r\n### Submission\r\nSubmit your app at the [Apps for America 2 Submission Form](http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica2/submit/).\r\n\r\n### Timeline\r\n* You develop apps between now and 11:59:59pm Pacific Time August 7th.\r\n* Between August 7th and August 22nd, our judges will select three finalists.\r\n* Everyone will vote for their favorite of the three finalists from August 24th to September 7th.\r\n* All the winners will be announced at Gov 2.0 Expo in Washington, DC on September 8th at Gov 2.0 Expo Showcase\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\ndigg_url = 'http://digg.com/programming/Data_gov_Launches_25_000_contest_for_best_app';\r\n</script>\r\n<script src=\"http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.reddit.com/button.js?t=2\"></script>",

   "description": "MAICgregator is a Firefox [extension](http://www.artwarez.org/femext/index.html) that aggregates information about colleges and universities embedded in the military-academic-industrial (MAIC) complex. It searches government funding databases, private news sources, private press releases, and public information about trustees to try and produce a radical cartography of the modern university via the replacement or overlay of this information on academic websites. This is a necessary activity in light of the contemporary financial \u201ccrisis\u201d.\r\n\r\nRecently there has been a flurry of Firefox add-on [development](http://artzilla.org/) both poetic and serious. We would be remiss to ignore the work of [Michael Mandiberg](http://www.mandiberg.com/) who was involved with two important early extensions, [Oil Standard](http://transition.turbulence.org/Works/oilstandard/) , a project that would replace dollar amounts on pages to their equivalents in barrels of oil, and [Real Costs](http://therealcosts.com/) , an add-on that shows carbon for alternative forms of transportation on major airline websites.  Similar in this vein is the recent [Add Art](http://add-art.org/) plugin by [Steve Lambert](http://visitsteve.com/) that replaces advertisements with curated net.art shows; [Track-me-not](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~dhowe/TrackMeNot/) , that floods Google with fake searches to descrease the efficacy of data mining; [turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) that allows people to see and respond to shady Amazon Mechanical Turk employers; and [China Channel](http://chinachannel.hk/) that lets people surf the web behind the Great Firewall of China. Besides these there are add-ons for \u201ccensoring\u201d text on a page using [black blocks](http://www.gleuch.com/projects/ctrl-f-d) as well as returning us to the heyday of [mid-1990s web design](http://timemachine.6x.to/) . This brief list of add-ons shows the extent to which artists are re-purposing the web browser for radical artistic purposes using technology that is (potentially/oftentimes) much easier to work with than in earlier net.art times.\r\n         \r\nWhile there might have been other ways to develop and release MAICgregator, it seemed most appropriate to develop it as a Firefox extension, especially given the ability in many places to (at least temporarily) install these plugins on public machines at colleges, universities, libraries, or internet caf\u00e9s. The ease by which extensions can be installed\u2014and the ability a programmer has to modify pages at will once the extension is installed\u2014makes them an ideal vector for the propagation of radical or alternative perspectives to those that are fixed on the web page itself. This is especially the case within the modern university, where schools carefully control what types of information make it to their front page or internal portals, or where students consume their news in computer-generated chunks via Google News, absent marginalized or alternative voices. Add-ons provide one way to break open this lock on web-based media, combining disparate sources together in a montage that is at once both serious and poetic.\r\n\r\nObviously a plug-in like MAICgregator is not going to immediately alter materially the construction of the military-academic-industrial-complex. Nevertheless, in just the short time we have been developing it, we have come to a much better understanding of the links between these major actors, as well as some of the more [strange players in the mix](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/UrologicalcareCom-958964.html) . Part of our intent is, yes, to provide carefully selected \u201cfacts\u201d about the relationships between universities, the military, and the corporate world. But just as equally our goal is to perform an alternative, to show how so-called \u201cnews\u201d sources can be recombined in new ways to create novel connections. This is a performance that additionally re-opens the consideration of exactly what the \u201cweb\u201d is, given its continued atrophy into staid configurations of a media-controlled semiotics. And it is finally a performance of what we might call a \u201cpoetic austerity\u201d: the use of whatever means are available to us\u2014absent the possibility of funding through traditional sources, given their decrease in this time of focusing on the \u201cessentials\u201d\u2014to respond to power on our own terms. While it might be feeble, while it might seem [utopian](http://brechtforum.org/who-will-build-ark-utopian-imperative-age-catastrophe) , it is certainly necessary nevertheless to do what we can, with what we have, against that which oppresses, by creating that which we want.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the MAICgregator project, please see the [full statement](http://maicgregator.org/statement) and [FAQ](http://maicgregator.org/FAQ)."

They can plot locations on the map representing charter schools, shovel-ready projects, coal-fired power plants, etc. Then visitors can filter the map to display selected types of data in particular political districts. If you are concerned about affordable housing with expiring use restrictions in Massachusetts, you can go to mapsforamerica.com, upload addresses, and then quickly generate a map of the properties in, say, Representative Michael Capuano\u2019s district. And then you can create a corresponding list of locations, to send to public officials, share with the media, etc. Points can be plotted on the map one-by-one or in large batches of CSV data.\r\n\r\n2.\tMaps for America also aims to supports the work of member-based and grassroots organizations by providing an easy, free tool for identifying supporters\u2019 reps and senators. An organizer can submit a batch of addresses, then get back a CSV file in which each address returns with districts and elected officials.\r\n\r\n3.\tMaps for America is built with three custom Drupal modules, now available for other Drupal developers to use to take advantage of Sunlight Labs\u2019 APIs. The Legislator Look-Up module creates a block which can be easily snapped into any sidebar, to enable visitors to look up legislators for a designated address. The District module tags geocoded website content with corresponding political districts, parties and legislators. And the Geocoder module processes large batches of addresses and then calls the District module to tag all of its newly generated content.\r\n"

By aggregating data from a variety of public sources, the network makes available the most complete data set possible for each representative and senator. Election years, historical results, maps of districts, words mentioned in congress, senators, and a variety of other information is made available within the context of a local dialogue. Everything is \"commentable\", and the service provides an easy-to-use forum for more substantive discussion. News suggestion, events listing/RSVPing, profiles (with images), a full-featured message system and a registration system that lets users easily identify their district are just some of the features. \r\n\r\nAn affiliation system is also included to allow the administrator of the service to add groups that users can add to their profiles. The goal of this feature down the line is to allow all of the outside groups lobbying for change along the lines of the community to be integrated into the service. \r\n\r\nI think the best description for this tool is that it's a social network for congressional change that's open for anyone to use, change and improve upon. By integrating the facts into the network, I hope that this tool will help create district communities around issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote for people reviewing the site's functionality: Check out the red speech bubbles to see the comment system, upload a picture to see the cropping for image profiles and try sending messages to multiple people."

This button acts just like a Digg, Reddit, or StumbleUpon button; but instead of sharing a publisher's content across the web, citizens will be using TellMyPolitician buttons to contact their representatives. When there is no button, citizens can use our bookmarklet to reach their politician from any webpage. [Add TellMyPolitician to your site today](http://tellmypolitician.com/siteinstructions).\r\n"

Based on the bill sponsorship and co-sponsorships, politicians get weighted issue scores, that are represented as varying sized issue tag clouds. This means that politicians have issues related to what bills they support rather than what they say.\r\n\r\nEfforts have also been made to provide good graphical UIs for party and partisanship. Bill lists show red and blue colored starts to represent the breakdown of party support. Politician links are usually colored for their party, for a quick visual overview.\r\n\r\nMost of the development time was spent building a data gathering application, which is in a separate code repository. That supporting and necessary app can be found at http://github.com/rughetto/api.billtrack.org/tree/master. This supporting application doesn't yet have web interface on my server.\r\n\r\nThe start of member related social stuff is underway. Currently, signing up with sufficient district information will provide you with a good dashboard providing a map of your district, your politicians and their issues.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of features that I want to implement, and details about these can be found at http://billtrack.org/volunteer/tech-roadmap"

   "description": "Word on the Street is a web widget that will automagically recognize the user's current location and display elected Congressional officials for that region (within the US).\r\n\r\nEach Senator, Representative, or other delegate is displayed in an easy to read format including a recent photo, contact information, relevant links, and any recent posts they have made to their primary blogs or to Twitter, or videos they posted to YouTube. WOTS can be easily embedded into any website, blog, or social networking site (coming soon), and is specially suited for use on the iPhone, Google Android, BlackBerry, and other GPS-equipped devices as well as web browsers for Mac, Windows, and Linux, without requiring any additional software installation, customization, registration, or hosting. Since it is nearly effortless to use (at least I hope it is) and provides a lot of useful and timely information to the user, I am hoping that it will help to increase political transparency and public participation in US government.\r\n\r\nHere's the basic flow:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. As soon as the widget has rendered, WOTS should recognize the general area where you're located and pull up the list of all senators, representatives, and any other delegates to Congress for your area. If you are outside the US or Google Maps wasn't able to detect your location, you can select it by clicking on the map or typing it in to the \"location\" field.\r\n   2. You can change your location at any time by clicking the \"change location\" link at the top. You can try just about anything - city, state, zip code, intersection should all work (thanks to Google Maps)! A more specific location should provide you with a specific person to contact for that area, while a more general area or state name will bring up a list of legislators for the region.\r\n   3. The contact info and links sections are pretty concise, while the posts area is a lot more interesting. There is a wealth of information about all these people in a variety of places, but I'm trying to make it easier for citizens to quickly get up to date on exactly what their representatives are up to - and soon, what they are voting for and spending your tax money on - and to contact them if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWord on the Street may be embedded into any blog or website using the following three lines of HTML:\r\n\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=__GOOGLE_API_KEY__\"></script>\r\n    <style type=\"text/css\">@import \"http://klokie.com/widgets/wots/css/style.css\";</style>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://klokie.com/widgets/wots/js/wots.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n\r\nA key is required to use the Google Maps API. Get one free from [http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nWord on the Street is dual licensed under the GPL and MIT licenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to help get Americans more interested and involved in politics, so they can not only follow what their elected leaders are doing on a daily basis, but more importantly feel like they can voice their opinions to people in power and feel like their voices are getting heard. Finding out exactly who those powerful people are, starting with the legislators in US Congress, is the first step toward making positive change.\r\n\r\n\r\n/Klokie"

The first is simply managing constituent communications. We can only imagine what it must be like to receive the overwhelming number of emails and faxes pouring into their office. Since much of it is auto-generated by advocacy groups, it's becoming harder to manage, and increasingly less helpful. Here each member of Congress can get a simple dashboard to track what their constituents want, and how it changes over time.\r\n\r\nSecond, staffers are totally overworked, but they still have to pull together mountains of research and legislation for their boss. There is a very well-funded industry of lobbyists who've spent years developing white papers and talking points, and when the time comes, they are more than willing to help. We think that over time, citizens can offer a better alternative, just like Wikipedia is now a better alternative to a very well-funded encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nThink of us as a citizen-powered think tank. In just a couple months, we've built a database of 1,800 talking points covering all sides of every important issue facing our country, and it's growing fast. You can search this database, or just ask us to put together research for whatever you're working on.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a whole lot of trust in our political discourse, indeed it can be difficult to discern the agenda behind a lot of political information. So we offer an unprecedented level of transparency. Every talking point indicates it's support or opposition to a given priority, and you can see how all sides of an issue rate it.   You can even see the author's own list of priorities, so it's clear where they are coming from. Our members span the entire gamut of political ideology, so you are destined to find at least a few people you consider crazy, just like Congress."

   "description": "What?\r\n\r\nRepresentMe focuses on how well your representatives and senators represent you.  It takes your opinions on bills and issues and compares them to how your elected officials voted.  It applies statistics, accounting for how strongly you feel about specific issues and bills.  The end result is a detailed breakdown of how well you are being represented.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nYour House Represenative and Senators are the only three people in congress you get to vote for.  Getting information on what these three people are doing should be quick, easy, and detailed.  RepresentMe focuses on things directly relevant to the voter and their representation. The goal is to affect people's opinions, positively and negatively.  To expose how well people are represented and on what issues.  Voters will know what to applaud them for, and which areas need improvement.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nRepresentMe employs a user driven weighting system to factor in personal preferences.  Some issues are more important to one person than another.  Some people feel more strongly for or against a bill.  RepresentMe captures this, providing a more accurate view of voter opinions.\r\n"

Alternatively, the members of a specific committee who received contributions from one or a selected set of industries can be highlighted by clicking on the industry\u2019s name.  The dollar amounts given or received are displayed alongside the names of members and industries.\r\n\r\nWhen the links from all industries to all members of a specific committee are simultaneously displayed, the large number of lines forms a dense, visually impenetrable web of flows of money and influence that parallel those, largely invisible, of the real world.\r\n\r\nThe code for creating the graphs in the browser (Internet Explorer) is written in Javascript.  PHP programs were used to access the APIs provided by the Center for Responsive Politics and to consolidate data for each committee as selected by the user.\r\n\r\nAdobe Flash\u00ae provides the drawing canvas which is used by the JavaScript code. The open source MTASC compiler was used to create the swf file providing the interface between Javascript and Flash.\r\n\r\nUltimately it is intended to add additional dimension to the graphs so that relationships among three or more sets of political actors can be diagrammed.  This more comprehensive view would include, for example, linkages among Congressmen, the firms whose PACs and employees contribute to them, as well as the contributions from lobbyists that the firms hire. It is also intended to add a geographical (GIS) dimension to help highlight the practice of the geographical dispersion of jobs and money by large federal contractors as part of their effort to influence federal legislators and other officials.\r\n"

Other people visiting that website can then listen to your call and read the article that supports the issue that you called to speak with your Congressperson about.\r\n\r\nYeas & Nays currently runs in Firefox with the installation of a metaweb plug-in called Shiftspace.  Once installed, a user invokes Yeas & Nays on a website of interest to her, and a widget appears that provides an interface to calling Congressional representatives.  The user types in her zipcode, and the Yeas & Nays widget makes a call to the Sunlight API to retrieve matching representative names and office numbers for that user.  The widget then asks the user to provide her phone number, and finally the system generates a phone call automatically via a VOIP Asterisk server that bridges the user's phone with the chosen representative's office phone.  At the end of the call, an mp3 recording of the user's call appears on the webpage that she initiated her call from.  \r\n\r\nYeas and Nays is the latest functionality added to Shiftspace.org, an application which provides an \u201copen source layer above any website.  A screencast demoing the application's functionality as well as example Yeas & Nays calls to Congress can be found at http://shiftspace.org/spaces/yeas-and-nays."
