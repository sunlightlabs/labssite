Andrei and Derek have worked long hours to get this in shape for the 111th, and there's a lot more to come.\r\n\r\nJust to address a couple points you raised (and David, perhaps this will address your concerns too):\r\n\r\n1) The 5,000 limit is relatively low, I agree. I think since we're new to this, we wanted to err on the low side to begin with and ramp up as demand increased. This was largely a technical consideration, since the APIs are on a new platform for us. If usage demands it, we'll re-examine the limits and bump them upwards. We can make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, so if this is a show-stopping limitation for you, drop me a note. We'll see what we can do.\r\n\r\n2) I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding of the noncompete clause is that it refers specifically to financial competition. In other words, we wouldn't want someone taking our API, turning it into a product or service and then selling it. (At least not without talking to us first.) It has nothing at all to do with who can and cannot use the API, just how.\r\n\r\n3) The \"archiving data\" clause is fairly boilerplate, and, frankly, pretty reasonable I think. My understanding is this restriction is intended to prevent users from systematically downloading all of the data, and storing it in perpetuity -- even after you stop using the API and/or your account is terminated. That isn't the intended use of the API, and from a data integrity standpoint makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nWe also aren't alone in having a limitation like this in place. CRP's terms, for example, have roughly the same restriction.\r\n\r\n4) Finally, there's the question of local media organizations using the API. The legalese here is a little dense, and perhaps we should make this clearer -- but we absolutely allow other news organizations to use our API. In fact, we specifically lifted the commercial use restriction with that in mind.\r\n\r\nThere's two reasons we did this: First, any lawyer will tell you there's no hard and fast rule about what constitutes commercial use. Technically, a blogger with Google ad words on his or her site could be considered a commercial entity. Secondly, The Times considers this API to be part of its journalistic mission, and wanted it to be as open as possible.\r\n\r\nIt seemed odd to us to release something that users like the DNC and RNC -- which are both noncommercial -- could take advantage of, but for-profits like TPMMuckraker could not. We felt the best solution was to drop that restriction entirely.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope that addresses some of the issues you raised, and thanks again for the mention.", "user_url": "http://www.aronpilhofer.com/", "submit_date": "2009-01-09 08:52:50", "ip_address": null, "object_pk": "34", "site": 1, "is_removed": 0, "user": null, "content_type": 15, "is_public": 1, "user_name": "Aron Pilhofer ", "user_email": "aron@nytimes.com"}}, {"pk": 50, "model": "comments.comment", "fields": {"comment": "Yuck.

Isn't *all* of the data here coming from public sources? Why prevent people from caching it locally? \r\n\r\n2. I think the point with the \"Financial Competition\" from your API is that at the end of the day, the line is too vague. And while your lawyers may tend to interpret it in one way on one day, they may choose to interpret it in another on another day. This is chilling, and why we wouldn't consider using it (or encourage people to use it) until it is further specified.\r\n\r\nThe API terms of services says \"use the NYT APIs for any commercial purpose or in any product or service that competes with products or services offered by NYT.\" \r\n\r\nThe \"or in any\" actually nullifies the commercial categorization earlier in the sentence.

Using such a parameter (a \"[nonce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce)\") is effective against CSRF, but, as Clay noted (more astutely than I, as I chased my initial impression down the garden path), [clickjacking isn't CSRF](http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/feb/twitter-dont-click-exploit). The request is generated and consumed within the same domain and without steps in between, just as it would be for a legitimate request. A nonce is protection against old requests being re-used, not new requests that are just generated without the user's knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe way to defend against clickjacking appears to be [JavaScript frame-busting](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/framebust.html), which would have protected Twitter by ensuring that their site couldn't have been contained in the hidden IFRAME the exploit used.\r\n\r\nLooking for more info on the exploit, I found [the original paper that introduced clickjacking to the world last year](http://www.sectheory.com/clickjacking.htm) and it explains in more detail the differences between CSRF and clickjacking and why nonces don't shield you from the latter.

I have a bit of a different take on things. In my experience consulting for small to medium sized non-profit clients, what they want to do with their sites can 90% of the time be covered by Drupal and Joomla (I imagine expression engine is in the same category), pretty efficiently. The larger clients have more integrated needs and typically have to go with a Convio/Kintera/Blue State, or custom solution. \r\n\r\nBut the emergence of these open source CMS tools in the past few years has been a great boon to our industry, as people can share modules, share developers, connect with other NGO's on the same platform to share ideas, and save money. It's just so much better than 4 years ago when they were all tied to specific vendors' proprietary systems, paying license fees for software that often wasn't even all that great. \r\n\r\nRe: hiring a developer and rolling your own, I'm surprised to hear you suggest this in 2009. My clients (again, the small to medium sized ones) don't want to be in the software maintenance business - most don't have the skills to know what they want or manage a developer and know what they built - and what happens when that developer leaves? They are typically left with a customized, quirky, and often largely useless pile of legacy code. \r\n\r\nI'm certainly no zealot but I think what Drupal/Joomla/Plone have brought to the social change sector are very very good things. Please don't run from people who believe in these platforms (though I agree the hard-core fundamentalists need to be tempered and \"opened\" themselves). The open source CMS movement is not perfect, but it's a huge improvement on the chaotic, dis-organized marketplace littered with failed platforms from before.

How can a \"normal person\" tell the difference between a decent programmer and a quack?  This is even more complex when you're in the Python/Ruby space, where the frameworks are so young that \"years of experience\" are pretty much irrelevant.\r\n\r\nI can understand why organizations are tempted by offerings like Drupal.  \"Look how much it can do out of the box!\"  You get functionality on Day 1 -- it's day 100 that's more questionable.", "user_url": "", "submit_date": "2009-02-23 13:13:29", "ip_address": null, "object_pk": "62", "site": 1, "is_removed": 0, "user": null, "content_type": 15, "is_public": 1, "user_name": "Jeff", "user_email": "jeff@casimircreative.com"}}, {"pk": 271, "model": "comments.comment", "fields": {"comment": "Clay,\r\n\r\nFirst off, you should mosdef add Cake/Symfony to the Django/RoR list. I think they are both great (PHP) frameworks, and use the MVC pattern.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, I think if an organization is ready and able to drop $40K+ on a CMS implementation, and want one that is pretty specific for it's needs, then you have a point. For all of these frameworks, writing a basic CMS for them is actually a fairly short project (and one that most experienced devs that use those frameworks probably already have in the bag), so building out from that in the directions that you really want to go is not such a bad idea. \r\n\r\nBut it's the sites that are less than $40K where the power of an open source CMS comes into play. It would be impossible to build a site with bells and whistles (forums, specialized forms, different views, easy menus, etc. - think of all of the varied CMS modules/add-ons out there) for $15K using a framework like that, whereas it would be completely possible to do with Drupal, for instance.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other big negatives to this approach. You'd need a developer who knows security well.

No issues! They've gone months without contacting us for help, even after some staff turn over. And the Web is integral to their theater operation, so I know it's not due to lack of use. This is the case with many of our clients. Not all. For some clients, what we built grew in scale to the point where we couldn't build every feature perfectly, leaving gaps in usability.

I've run the gauntlet of building a CMS from scratch to organizing DrupalCamps to where I am today, which is pretty agnostic / pragmatic about the whole thing. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like you agree that there's a use for content management systems, and -- in some scenarios -- they just make sense. If a client is setting up a blog, we recommend blogging software, a online shop: shops software ... and so on.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the line between content management systems and application frameworks is starting to blur, probably to the benefit of some (those that work exclusively within those CMSs) and the detriment of others (typically, those clients that have to live with a \"FrankenApp\" -- part CMS, part applications, all bad user experience). \r\n\r\nThe other dynamic is the knowledge acceleration and production efficiency that is possible by focusing on just one CMS, as many consultancies do these days. There is no doubt, it's possible to make things faster and cheaper when there's only one tool for the job, and you know it inside and out. \r\n\r\nBut, these two dynamics are helping to create the same monocultures in the F/LOSS CMS environment that used to be reserved for propriety systems.

The difference is they'll need to write less code, there's a much larger body of best-practices to work off if they're a junior-level hire (which is likely at $40k), and if they totally blow it it's easier to find a replacement who doesn't need to start from scratch.\r\n\r\nI think an important thing we can agree on is \"competent\" and \"inside the organization\" give you the best shot for excellence.

They decide to use Drupal as their CMS. While it does much out of the box, a consultant needs to be hired to create templates for the great new design that was created for the web site.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything is great, but the organization wants some maps on the site generated with shape files they have. The consultant then creates a Drupal module to accomplish this. It isn't a problem that fits neatly into the concept of nodes, but they make it work. As the site grows they keep getting custom features added. Each feature only adds to the complexity of the customization and forces the developer to hack around the CMS's limitations. And they have now tied themselves to a mangled system that will only hinder their progress in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is completely wrong to think that by not using a CMS you have to build everything from scratch. Django, for instance, has applications for almost anything a basic web site would need. The cost of tying these apps into the site is on par with the Drupal customization. The development of the custom maps module would actually be cheaper and faster because the developer would be enabled by their framework instead of working _against_ the CMS.\r\n\r\nAnd while it is true that an organization may not have the knowledge or means to hire a talented developer, they probably also do not have the knowledge or means to hire a competent CMS customizer. It will be just as difficult to bring on someone that can hack their way around poorly written CMS customizations as it would be to find someone to figure out a custom developed solution.\r\n\r\n\"Small Pieces Loosely Joined\", as Phillip Smith wrote, is the key here. CMS customizations are always tightly coupled to their environment no matter how well they are coded. Well written framework applications can often be run in non-web contexts and are loosely tied to the rest of the web site.\r\n\r\nSunlightFoundation.com is a good example of this. We develop the custom modules that we need. These can be reused on our other web sites. They are loosely tied to the framework itself so it would be fairly trivial to modify them to work with other frameworks. We also have the ability to use WordPress for our blog and to easily delegate tasks to other non-framework applications.\r\n\r\nWe have the flexibility we need to have an effective web presence.\r\n\r\nYou would be hard pressed to convince me that a CMS customization would be cheaper or more beneficial for the organization in the long run.\r\n\r\nFor an example of good, extensible framework applications, see [Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/).", "user_url": "http://sunlightlabs.com/", "submit_date": "2009-02-23 17:00:15", "ip_address": "", "object_pk": "62", "site": 1, "is_removed": 0, "user": 1, "content_type": 15, "is_public": 1, "user_name": "Jeremy Carbaugh", "user_email": "jcarbaugh@sunlightfoundation.com"}}, {"pk": 291, "model": "comments.comment", "fields": {"comment": "CMSs are full of baked-in opinions.

Otherwise, you'll be doing the same things everyone else can do because they have the same consultants. \r\n* Content management systems are no longer expected to just manage web content.

Ruby has Rack, which rocks. With WSGI and Rack, we can compose apps of apps in a more pure way, much better than plugins/components in frameworks, and definitely better than modules in Drupal.\r\n", "user_url": "http://luigimontanez.com/", "submit_date": "2009-02-23 17:43:04", "ip_address": null, "object_pk": "62", "site": 1, "is_removed": 0, "user": null, "content_type": 15, "is_public": 1, "user_name": "Luigi Montanez", "user_email": "luigi.montanez@gmail.com"}}, {"pk": 298, "model": "comments.comment", "fields": {"comment": "@shawn\r\nLet's just keep the goodness of Umbraco to ourselves!", "user_url": "", "submit_date": "2009-02-23 17:45:17", "ip_address": null, "object_pk": "62", "site": 1, "is_removed": 0, "user": null, "content_type": 15, "is_public": 1, "user_name": "Craig", "user_email": "craig@flyght-of-fantasy.co.uk"}}, {"pk": 299, "model": "comments.comment", "fields": {"comment": "I think there's a lot of truth to what Clay's saying, but I wouldn't go as far.

I think Clay's key quote is this one: \"you're going to run into something that your content management system can do and does poorly.\" CMSes produce disappointment because, by design, they're general solutions built for unsophisticated administrators.  If you've got a developer and a framework, he'll tailor the workflow to the problem so tightly that there'll be less room for those using the interface to make errors.  If he's using a CMS he'll probably lean on existing junk that's lying around and produce a system that probably took just as long to build, but which isn't as nice.\r\n\r\nBut there's so much other stuff he *didn't* have to build.  Jeremy's GIS example is instructive, I think.  There are actually <a href=\"http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-geocms\">a bunch of foundational modules</a> supporting exactly this sort of thing.

It's a bit overweight, but the caching systems surrounding it make this not much of a problem.  Is this as elegant as a ground-up GIS solution?  No, of course not.  But it'll get you most of the way there without needing to edit a line of code.\r\n\r\nBut I'm rambling.  In the end I think it comes down to what others have said: if you've got the resources to do sophisticated framework-based development and have a problem to solve that's more interesting than wanting a blog with some web 2.0 junk stapled on, you should use a framework.

The selling point is always \"you will no longer have to work with your tech staff to be on the Web.\"\r\n\r\nMany people dream that their tech staff should be plug'n'play.  But if you're at all serious about the Web, your tech lead is as vital to your organization as your comms director or the other leadership positions.  If you get a new comms director, he or she will evaluate the messaging strategy in place, and then probably rip it all out after a bit, taking some things they find useful from the existing elements and discarding the rest.  This is no different from the approach your tech lead will take.  \r\n\r\nThere is a political issue here; there are only so many slices to the power pie in any org.  Bringing the tech lead to the table can be a scary proposition , especially for the comms/fundraising/activism people whose expertise -- REAL and VALUABLE expertise, I must stress -- doesn't look as shiny and pretty as the jargony strategies that your technical lead will be able to propose and get online in short turnaround.  Sometimes the Web guy becomes the go-to guy that your policy leadership turns to, bypassing the comms/fundraising/advocacy experts, resulting in a muddle rather than effective advocacy etc;  more often, the messaging/fundraising/activism people try to relegate the technical lead to a semi-clerical position.  \r\n\r\nNeither approach is a recipe for success.

Same with fundraising and advocacy; and in any organization with real success online, the same with their technical approach.

Now we're an [open source development team](http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2008/12/19/labs2/) that builds technology to make government more transparent and accountable. We also provide technical support to [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com) sponsored projects.\r\n\r\nBasically, we are people that get to play around with cool data and technology every day. Want a [job](http://transparencyjobs.com) doing the same thing?\r\n\r\n#### So you just put data from Excel spreadsheets onto Google maps?\r\n\r\nNot at all! A lot of effort goes into making government data useful. Most of the data that the government publishes is very messy. Names of people and organizations are often spelled differently across databases. Dates and numbers are formatted differently. Obscure codes are used differently between nearly identical records. To make matters worse, much of the data that Congress is required to publish is contained in unparseable PDFs or in books in small rooms in the Capitol building.\r\n\r\nMaking government data usable is hard work!\r\n\r\nWe also spend a lot of time finding ways to make data useful to the general public. Staring at spreadsheets is boring and confusing. Data has to be presented in a way that is intriguing, visually appealing, and easy to understand.\r\n\r\n#### Who works in the Labs?\r\n\r\nCoders, designers, database people, a really smart systems engineer, and [burrito](http://twitter.com/welldressed/) fans.\r\n\r\n#### Do you have lab coats?\r\n\r\nYes, we do.", "enable_comments": 0}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": 0, "title": "Apps for America ~ Sunlight Labs Mashup Contest", "url": "/appsforamerica/", "template_name": "labs/contest.html", "sites": [1], "content": "### What it Is\r\n\r\nApps for America is Sunlight's annual development contest!

In my consulting days, I watched companies and  political campaigns and non-profits sometimes spend hundreds of thousands of dollars annually trying to make their content management system do what they wanted it to do for their online campaigns. As an honest developer and honest consultant, this made me apoplectic-- I knew that at the end of the day, technically what they wanted was fairly easy to build. But they had to pay hundreds of dollars an hour to get a \"Drupal Specialist\" at an outside consultancy to set up simple pages because they could not figure out how to get the stuff to work right.\r\n\r\nNow, this experience isn't solely limited to Drupal. From working on the Dean Campaign to consulting for hundreds of clients at Blue State Digital, to working at a non-profit like the Sunlight Foundation, I don't think I've ever been happy with a content management system. I've tried dozens, from the ever so simple blog engines like [TextPattern](http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Index) and [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), to the more complex [Drupal](http://drupal.org), [MovableType](http://movabletype.com/), and [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com/), to the full-scale content management systems like [Typo3](http://typo3.com/), [Bricolage](http://www.bricolage.cc/), I feel like I've worked on and with as many content management systems as I possibly can in my career. And I can't help but feel as though I've never been satisfied with any of them.\r\n\r\nAmazingly, I can't find anybody that's used their content management system that doesn't seem to either be resigned to using it, or have an amazing amount of contempt for it. People really hate their content management systems and I think the reason why is because full-blown Content Management Systems just don't work for any kind of sophisticated online presence. At the end of the day, you're probably going to want to do something that Content Management System can't do or worse-- you're going to run into something that your content management system _can_ do and does poorly. \r\n\r\nSee-- the problem with a full scale [Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system) is that it has too many opinions. Those opinions were though of by somebody other than you and the needs of your organization. The more developed a content management system (or any piece of software, really) the more \"opinions\" it has. And the more \"opinions\" it has, the more likely one of them is going to really tick you off. Especially in the world of Content Management. Those opinions could be anything from \"What should the admin interface of the website look like\" to \"how should workflow work for the editorial process\" to \"What kind of user registration system should there be\" or a plethora of other opinions like \"how should data be stored\" and \"how does a designer interact with me.\" More often than not, one of these pieces of functionality is bound to create frustration and anger-- potentially rage for either you or your users.\r\n\r\nOur alternative is to take a step back from Content Management Systems. You have [software frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)-- generally a programmer's toolkit used to build things like Content Management Systems or other web applications. Instead of spending lots of money on a content management system and paying a specialist integrator to create and install and maintain it, you're better off finding a competent developer that is well versed in a framework like [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). One competent developer using either of these frameworks can weave together a content management _solution_ and constantly be developing tools inside of this solution that make sense for your organization.\r\n\r\nWith Government in particular you end up with even more problems going the standard CMS route. When Government picks a CMS over a framework, Government is basically saying that they're going to trust the CMS's standard way of delivering data or work to change those standards and replace them with new ones. It seems to me that especially in Government it is far more effective to be using frameworks than CMSes. Recovery.gov, for instance, isn't a content management problem but a data delivery problem. Government should be focused on delivering that data in the most thorough way possible and when you factor all the different data sources that recovery.gov is going to have to talk to, I'd much rather be using python than trying to hack within the confines Drupal to do the job.\r\n\r\nThere's some arguments against taking this route. The most knee-jerk one is \"you're throwing away so much functionality\" when you don't use something like Drupal. But the point of frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails is so that much of the common functionality (user logins, registration, even things like social networks and shopping carts) can easily be baked in to any application in the way a developer and a customer chooses. They can be built custom or sewn together through components and plug-ins.\r\n\r\nThe second argument is: \"But Drupal/ExpressionEngine/[Silverstripe](http://silverstripe.com) is a framework, too!\" and it isn't. It just simply isn't. Drupal and the like are content management systems that may have modular hooks in them to build other software, but the software crosses the line into content management systems when it starts providing default user-experiences out of the box. This means you have to un-do the way default behavior works and apply what you want as desired behavior rather than writing behavior from scratch. That's where the primary difference is between a Content Management System and a Framework are: a framework provides a minimal amount of user-facing functionality (it may provide simple ways to create it) but generally focuses on providing tools that make a developer's life easier.\r\n\r\nThe third is: \"Integration\" which for most organizations is a quixotic windmill chase if there ever was one. In my years of working on voter databases, targeting tools, contribution systems and email systems people constantly asked for all these systems to be integrated, but when asked for practical reasons why they often came up short. When you do have those practical reasons-- those integrated queries you want to run on your user data -- your developer can make that happen to you probably better than you can with squeezing your data needs into a CMS.\r\n\r\nThere's also some gray area here -- a \"Third Way\" if you will. Sometimes a framework gets extracted out of a content management system. [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/), for instance, was extracted out of ExpressionEngine, and [Sapphire](http://silverstripe.org/sapphire) was extracted out of Silverstripe. You may be tempted to say \"Hey, this is the best of both worlds!\" and it could be, but keep in mind that you're still choosing to adopt a bunch of opinions in your software from people who don't have your organization's priorities in mind. The point is to start with a framework that allows you to build solutions rapidly rather than to buy off on somebody else's solutions. Also, you have content management systems like [Ellington](http://www.ellingtoncms.com/) and [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/) that are built on these pre-existing frameworks. Same deal applies-- just because the content management system is built on a framework, even one that you like,  doesn't mean that the design of the content management system works for your organization. It is likely better and cheaper to build a solution that works for you out of the framework.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that you need to build every application in your web presence from scratch. At Sunlight, for instance, we use [Blue State Digital](http://bluestatedigital.com)'s[1] mailer and advocacy tools and integrate them seamlessly into our campaigns when they fit the bill. They're a great provider of services that fit around what we need. We're happy to drop in other off the shelf solutions as well-- the [Sunlight Foundation blog](http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com), being a blog and all, is powered by WordPress. But when it comes to content management and end user experience, we want to control the user experience as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNow, this isn't a decision for everyone to make. But if you are sitting there thinking about your content management needs and trying to figure out how to \"power\" your website and a vendor has given you a bid somewhere close to or over $40,000 for the first year of purely technical work, consider shopping around for a full time Django or Ruby on Rails developer instead. You'll find yourself with the ability to do more, faster.\r\n\r\nOne last caveat: never hire anybody who is religious about their software. If somebody believes that \"Rails is the solution!\" or engages you in a debate about why \"Drupal creates so much possibility for our movement\" and tries to inject some form of zealotry into your thought process, get away from them as quickly as you can. Writing good software is, at the end of the day, not about the framework you use or the content management system you're an expert at, but about being a good developer. A good developer is going to seem nearly agnostic about the tools that they use and instead be able to converse with you and develop the solution that is right for the problem. A language like Python or Ruby or PHP doesn't matter nearly as much as the competency of a developer. A great developer is going to be able to do amazing things in any language or framework. \r\n\r\n**Update 5:06pm** *It should be noted here that this isn't a Drupal specific post, though it seems like there's a lot of anger from the Drupal community about this post. To those that think that this is a direct attack on Drupal/Your Favorite CMS, I ask that you take another look through the article and keep a level head. It isn't. Another misunderstanding is that this is specifically geared towards the Open Source community, which it isn't.*\r\n\r\nNext, there's a new argument I didn't account for that I should have: \"doing it all yourself means if your developer gets hit by a bus, you're going to be out of luck!\" That's not true exclusively of frameworks vs. content management systems. That's where the competency comes in: if you hire a competent ruby developer to build a Ruby on Rails solution for you and help you maintain it, that code will be maintainable, just as if you hired a competent ExpressionEngine developer to make modifications to EE Core.

The first thing users will notice is that there is a very large headline that states: \u201cAdministering and Enforcing Federal Campaign Finance Laws\u201d, which is fine for lawyers who come to visit the site but I think it scares away a lot of the regular public. In fact, the FEC\u2019s primary goal according to its charter is disclosure, not administration or enforcement. We think the design and functionality of the FEC website should reflect that primary mandate. Looking at this current site I don\u2019t see a lot that would suggest that right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/fec_homepage.jpg\" alt=\"FEC title on home page\"/>\r\n\r\n<p>The second thing most users will notice, if they happen to come to the the site on a day when there is an alert, is that there is scrolling text on the bottom of the webpage. It certainly does grab your attention, but because it\u2019s scrolling across the screen, it\u2019s more difficult to read and very distracting when you\u2019re trying to read something else on the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we move on to the navigation. There are too many menus! There are menus on 3 sides of the site and when you rollover buttons on 2 of the sides, drop down menus appear. This creates too much confusion for the user when they are trying to find information and navigate the site. Then there is a skip navigation button that appears above the top menu that shouldn\u2019t even be visible to the regular user. This is simply used for screen readers so that when a person with a disability is using the site the screen reader won\u2019t list off every single button in menus (thanks to Jeremy for this explanation). Finally, when you resize the browser window, the layout breaks and the search box disappears behind the menu. Considering that search is a primary means of navigation for people these days, this deserves fixing.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/fec_fullHome.jpg\" alt=\"FEC current home page\"/>\r\n\r\n<h3>The New</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So I started attacking the site by pay attention to the needs of the normal user. I surfaced and focused on what they would generally be interested in: campaign funds and candidate profiles. I placed some of this information on the home page but most importantly I placed radio buttons with these options below the search box to provide a faceted search allowing users to more quickly access the content they\u2019re seeking. The rest of the home page feels more accessible and open to the public by adding the seminar schedule (if a user wanted more information and wanted to attend a conference), and the commission calendar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important part of the home page is the feature section. By adding this, there is now a place for the FEC to place current information without distracting from all other content on the page and a great space to feature new and interesting visuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the navigation, I did a quick inventory of the information that is currently on fec.gov. In doing this I found that there were a lot of things that could be paired down. For example, instead of having a search for each individual database why not just have one search but give the user more options up front so that they can narrow their search. I also placed the search box in a more prominent place so that users would use this as the main way to navigate the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the interior pages I just organized and structured the data by adding striping to the charts and adding graphics for more interest where they made sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we also spent some time considering the backend.

The site has a nice design and places for all sorts of useful content and could has potential to serve as a portal for all sorts of useful information on current legislation (albeit from an admittedly partisan point of view).\r\n\r\nThe thing that caught my eye however was the prominent inclusion of a section on the site titled RSS & API.  This section shows RSS feeds for various sections on the site, House committees, and GOP 'Solutions' to pressing issues including the Economy, Energy, and Healthcare.  Unfortunately as of the time of writing none of these links work.\r\n\r\nHoping I would have more luck with the API I clicked over and was at first quite impressed.  The `GOP Anywhere API documentation`_  includes methods to get details on members of congress, committees, bills, votes, and various other documents.  In other words, the same thing that APIs like the `NY Times Congress API`_, `Project Vote Smart API`_, and many others aim to include -- but potentially from a more official and accurate source.\r\n\r\nI immediately signed up for an API key, signup was relatively painless, asking for the regular information (name, zipcode, email) and the examples looked good as well so I figured I'd be using the API almost immediately.  Upon firing up an interactive python session to play around I found that the simple registration process had created a false sense of security as instead I was greeted with a host of problems:\r\n\r\n* It is fairly confusing where to get your API key (both a coworker and I stumbled here at first), the URL referenced in the examples does not exist, but the key is shown to logged in users on the front page of the API documentation.\r\n* All of the API methods have to be accessed via `HTTP POST` when in fact all of the methods are simply retrieving (or GET-ting) data.  This should be relatively simple to fix, and would do wonders for allowing users to experiment with the API without a client library.\r\n* The documentation implied that you had to use an https URL (although this doesn't appear to be true and hopefully never is enforced) \r\n* There are four examples of how to make a call to the API, but written in what seems like a peculiar choice of languages: perl, VBScript, ASP.NET, and JSP.  None of these languages are exactly the languages thriving in the kind of mashup communities that an API presumably serves.  I would have expected to see at least one example in PHP, Ruby, or Python.\r\n* members.get for a Democratic district returns \"ERROR: Member Does Not Exist\" and for districts in which a Republican was ousted in the 2008 elections seems to return the defeated Republican with no indication that the representative in question is no longer in office. (an example of this is NY-29th's Randy Kuhl)\r\n* Unfortunately it is difficult to judge the rest of the API as most of the documented methods do not appear to work. see [1]_ \r\n* Finally, are Senators included?  The site seems to make no mention of this but I don't see why they shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nMany of these questions would best be discussed for most APIs on a mailing list or with some sort of API contact, but no such official list exists and the only feedback mechanism is an email address listed with a disclaimer stating that the API is not supported.  This is hardly the way to foster a community of developers building upon and improving your tools.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that some of these problems can be addressed (most likely the API simply isn't entirely online yet and the missing documentation and methods will be up shortly) but some of these are more serious.  As far as examples of access in other languages, the community can provide those (if and when the API becomes fully functional, I'll offer to do the python ones)  Although this is GOP.gov, it seems worthwhile for Republicans and Democrats alike to be returned in methods like member.get.  Allow filtering by party of course, but to simply return no data or incorrect data seems to do a disservice to all would-be users of this potentially valuable service.\r\n\r\nThe GOP is clearly trying to make an effort to offer data to the public in new and interesting ways and for that they should be commended.  I would hope that they see fit to include Democratic legislators as well (even if the GOP.gov site exists to serve primarily partisan interests, tracking the votes of Democrats seems valuable enough).  \r\n\r\nPerhaps with some improvements and a little bit of work from both sides of the aisle the GOP.gov API can become the house.gov API.\r\n\r\n..

Part one covers the basics of web standards and progressive enhancement and Section 508 standards \u00a71194.22 (a)-(f)._\r\n\r\nLabs designer Ali Felski [recently posted](http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/01/23/rethinking_usagov/) about an experiment in redesigning the web site of [USA.gov](http://usa.gov). One of the commenters on the post felt that the design would not be feasible as it is not compliant with [Section 508 accessibility standards](http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12). I disagree. It is nearly impossible to infer a site's compliance with Section 508 from the design.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I worked (contracted) as a Section 508 tester for the Treasury Department on their [Governmentwide Accounting and Reporting Modernization](http://www.fms.treas.gov/gwa/) project. Since then I have developed applications for the IRS and FBI that have had to implement Section 508 standards. There seems to be quite a bit of confusion over the implications of Section 508 and the effort involved in implementing the standards... even amongst those dealing with it each day. In this two-part post I will dispel some of the misconceptions and show how easy it is to accomplish when sites are developed with web standards and progressive enhancement.\r\n\r\n### Developing with web standards\r\n\r\nWhen developing with web standards, there are three important things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n*   HTML is content\r\n*   CSS is presentation\r\n*   JavaScript is behavior\r\n\r\nThink about it for a minute and let it sink in. Most people think of HTML as that markup language that is used to layout web pages. This, however, is a violation of the separation of layers. HTML is meant to give semantic meaning to your content. __p__ tags denote paragraphs. __div__ tags indicate logic divisions within content. __table__ tags are used for tabular data and _not for layout_... as tempting as it is.\r\n\r\n__img__ tags are another good example. You would probably think that the Sunlight Labs logo at the top of this page is rendered with an __img__ tag in the HTML. By doing this we would be including presentation elements in our content. The proper way to implement this is by using an __h1__ tag containing 'Sunlight Labs' and using CSS [image replacement techniques](http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=ImageReplacement) to display the logo image on the page instead of the text. One of the benefits of this method is that our organization name is included in the content of the page rather than locked away in an image.\r\n\r\n### Progressive enhancement\r\n\r\nSo far we've seen an example of maintaining a separation of content and style. [Progressive enhancement](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement) is a method of separating content and behavior.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if we don't maintain of separation of content and behavior and the user has JavaScript disabled? In most cases the page will either be missing content or not function correctly. By creating fully functional web sites without JavaScript and then layering on behavioral features, it is possible to create functional and rich user experiences.\r\n\r\n### Section 508 Guidelines\r\n\r\n*   #### (a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via \"alt\", \"longdesc\", or in element content).\r\n\r\n    If we properly separate our three layers, we remove most of the situations in which we would have to provide text equivalents. Markup should only include __img__ tags when the image is actually part of the content of the page (i.e. [Flickr](http://flickr.com) or [Boston.com's The Big Picture](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/)).\r\n\r\n    _The lesson:_ Logos, navigation, buttons and other content elements are not proper uses of __img__ tags. When non-text content is necessary, use title and alt attributes.\r\n\r\n*   #### (b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation.\r\n\r\n    That fancy Java slideshow applet that adds ripple effects to the slides probably isn't necessary. Simplify your life and make basic HTML pages styled with CSS instead. \r\n\r\n    _The lesson:_ If you do need multimedia capabilities, use technologies that have accessibility options. \r\n\r\n*   #### (c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup.\r\n\r\n    Users with colorblindness or screen readers can't tell a red icon from a green icon. If all you have in your HTML is an __img__ tag, you are hiding content from people that are unable to see the page. Be sure to have meaningful text content in your HTML whenever you are conveying information with color.\r\n\r\n\t_The lesson:_ Color is presentation, not content. Convey all information as text in HTML and use styles heets to make it pretty and colorful.\r\n\r\n*   #### (d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet.\r\n\r\n    Remember our three layers of separation?\r\n\r\n    _The lesson:_ If you have created a page that needs CSS or JavaScript to be readable, you have violated our \"HTML is content\" principle. Semantic markup without styles creates HTML that is meaningful even if it is boring to look at.\r\n\r\n*   #### (e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map.\r\n\r\n    Don't use image maps as they are almost always unnecesary. Simple as that.\r\n\r\n    _The lesson:_ Provide basic text interactions with plain old HTML. If rich interactions are necessary, enable them by using progressive enhancement techniques.\r\n\r\n*   #### (f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape.\r\n\r\n    _The lesson:_ Didn't we agree to not use image maps?\r\n\r\nStay tuned for part two where we explore standards (g)-(p)!", "date_published": "2009-01-27 23:33:20", "comment_count": 1, "slug": "section-508-compliance-easier-you-think", "tags": "section508 webstandards"}}, {"pk": 48, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "public", "last_updated": "2009-01-26 01:32:31", "author": 3, "timestamp": "2009-01-26 01:32:31", "markup": "none", "title": "Weekly Lab Report 2009.02", "excerpt": "You probably heard a new President was inaugurated this past week and that his first memo from the White House was about TRANSPARENCY.

It\u2019s kind of nice to be able to navigate based on audience, but at the same time who really thinks of himself as an audience? With people changing all the time wouldn\u2019t you want your government site to change with you instead of pigeon-holing you?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/usaGov_navBar.jpg\" alt=\"navigation on usa.gov\"/>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the main content of the site just seems generally random. To get to the content you\u2019re after, it involves many clicks and there is little to draw the user\u2019s eye to the most important content on a page.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/usaGov_content.jpg\" alt=\"content on usa.gov\"/>\r\n\r\n<h3>The New</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In thinking about a new structure and new design for usa.gov we had a few goals that we wanted to accomplish. They basically were: letting the user customize and personalize the content that was displayed on the site, having better structure and navigation, and just having a cleaner, more powerful overall look to the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think a great way to make the government more accessible to the public is to ensure content is relevant to each person by allowing them to customize usa.gov. With a simple login, users could save information that was relevant to them instead of painfully sifting though links and then having to do it all over again when they might want the same content down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking that idea a step further would be pulling content from other government websites. For example, if you have student loans and what to see your balance, or if you just need to know where you\u2019re currently registered to vote, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to see all of that content in one place? There is lots of data out there like this\u2013medicare, social security, where your local post office is or even what kind of expenditures have been made by the federal government\u2013that when opened up, would allow the Government to serve the public better and give the user a better experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For navigation, I again placed the search box front and center, and then decided on three small tabs: my government (which would have your personal government information), my community (just want it sounds like: federal community events, school data and where federal money is being spent in your area), and my elected officials (who your federal elected officials are, how to contact them, where they get their money, etc.). I think breaking things out this way makes the user feel a sense of ownership (their cognitive ownership bias coming into play) which will encourage them to come back more frequently and invest time customizing their window into the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I needed to organize and declutter the interface. I went with a clean look using neutral colors and pulled cues from change.gov for some continuity between government sites. This was accomplished by adding more white space, using the more primary colors (blue and red) when I needed to call attention to the content, and visualizing data so that users would be able to better understand it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Reveal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the smaller images below to view the full comps.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/images/usa_gov_mygovFinal.jpg\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/usaGov_comp1.jpg\" alt=\"content on usa.gov\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/images/usa_communityFinal.jpg\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/usaGov_comp2.jpg\" alt=\"content on usa.gov\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/images/usa_gov_myrepsFinal.jpg\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightlabs.com/site/images/usaGov_comp3.jpg\" alt=\"content on usa.gov\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course there were many challenges in doing this. For example, any personalization of a site would clearly have security and privacy concerns, especially with the government law concerning persistent cookies. But would leaving vital information like account numbers, social security numbers, addresses and full names help mitigate this concern? And technically all this data could be pulled instantly, so the combination of this data would only exist inside of a session. So with that in mind this isn\u2019t necessarily something that the government should immediately take and implement, but will hopefully be a conversation starter about the possibilities that are out there for an overall better face to the government.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2009-01-23 14:10:12", "comment_count": 19, "slug": "rethinking_usagov", "tags": "design"}}, {"pk": 46, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "public", "last_updated": "2009-01-23 09:39:42", "author": 6, "timestamp": "2009-01-23 09:39:42", "markup": "markdown", "title": "Does your Rep have an RSS Feed?", "excerpt": "Sunlight Labs contributor \"wubbahead\" comes up with an ingenious and automated way to find out whether or not your representative has an RSS feed by using the [Sunlight Labs API](http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api) the [Google AJAX Feed API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/documentation/reference.html#lookupFeed) and some JavaScript.

Originally, we thought \"hey, let's put this into [Public Markup](http://publicmarkup.org)\" but unfortunately the bill's complexity actually was incompatible with Public Markup's data model. At the end of the day, the relevant parts of the bill wouldn't have fit into the commenting/displaying architecture we've used for bills in the past. \r\n\r\nSo we started on a different route, of getting the bill into a different data model so that people could comment on that. We then experimented with services like [disqus](http://disqus.com) for commenting so that we could get it out the door quickly. But during the design phase, we really struggled to find a good, usable way to comment. Then the question came up: why are we doing this? How does this change things? Allowing people to comment on this bill, section by section didn't seem up our alley or particularly revolutionary in terms of resource expenditures. So we got thinking: what if we just came up with a way to easily visualize the spending in the bill. That would be useful.\r\n\r\nSo Jeremy and I started parsing through the bill both with digital parsers and manually and managed to build a spreadsheet of all of the expenditures we could find. But the thing is-- we only were able to come up with $356,421,500,000 worth of stimulus. This is a far reach from 60% of \"875 billion dollars\" (the other 40% are tax cuts). We started getting worried that maybe our non-lawyery minds weren't able to find all the expenditures. This led to a chain of events where we said \"hey, you know what, if we can't be accurate, we'd better not go any further,\" at least officially as the Sunlight Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems Congress should not only embrace XML to show bills to the public but it should also create new ways for Congress to express that information so that machines (and people) can provide context to them. \r\n\r\nSo we're sort of at a loss for what to do next. We got the data into a [spreadsheet](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p-kX0k_KXgtwwzHnvEn4eCA) and verified it against the bill text three times. With two sets of eyes. We're not saying we are perfect, but that's been checked over a few times. But where's the rest of the money? Can you help us find it? What have our non-lawyerly minds missed?

Government should be focusing *first* on providing access to data in as unrestricted of a way as possible and inviting developers to build interfaces on top of it, and\r\n2. Often times it is possible in this field to try too hard and to do too much work. A simple solution is sometimes a superior solution.\r\n\r\nHere's why-- as of today on the \"Your Seat at the Table\" page: \r\n\r\n1. Several of the documents on the front page have dates in the future. \r\n2. You can only search once every 15 seconds. \r\n3. It looks like it just got caught up, but for several weeks (from Dec. 22 to about January 9th) the site was nearly dormant and had weeks of missing data.\r\n4. There's not a clear message of what's going to happen to the data after January 20th.\r\n\r\nI'm *certain* that there's a strong amount of effort being put on this by the administration and they're taking it very seriously, but I wonder if they can really keep up with the documents they're getting. Maybe there's another way to do it.\r\n\r\nHere's the simpler approach. Maybe they should start by standardizing the names of the documents, and put them on an FTP server or an index-free http page; updating that FTP server when documents come in and are sanitized; writing one blog post pointing to the repository. In the blog post, say \"people are encouraged to build their own search interfaces and browsing interfaces to the data as they see fit\" \r\n\r\nThe result? You'll likely have the Sunlight Labs [community](http://sunlightlabs.com) scrambling to build an interface, [Watchdog.net](http://watchdog.net) parsing the data and incorporating it, and media organizations like the New York Times working on their own too. More eyeballs would be on the data, and they'd earn praise from the media and technology community for being participatory and more open.\r\n\r\nLet me add one big caveat here: This effort by the Transition team is a special case. We know they have been moving at the government equivalent of light speed, and in a situation where they had no infrastructure to work with. What I suggest above would have the effect of deputizing outside help for an urgent and atypical problem. I'm not sure approach whether what I suggest above should be a general model for such work (though I am inclined that way), but it would have been away to do it better in this instance. \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you take a look at the  [data](http://siteanalytics.compete.com/opensecrets.org+fec.gov/?metric=uv) you'll see a trend-- when the data can be taken from the Government, people do more interesting things with it and it gets in front of more eyeballs. The Government should always be keeping a keen eye towards *first* making the data available to citizens, and *then* building tools and interfaces on top of it.\r\n\r\nThe point is this: This transparency business gets really tough if you make it tough, but if you're looking for the easy way out, there's likely a much simpler solution. And often the simpler ones end up being more sophisticated and impressive anyhow.

Here at Sunlight Labs we are always happy to see new APIs that wrap government data and there is definitely a lot to like here, although there are some things that will hopefully change to make the API more useful to the community at large.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\n========\r\n\r\nThere can never be too many ways to access this kind of government data, the more that are out there, the more they will be used, and ultimately that is one of our primary goals here at Sunlight Labs.  There are a few really nice design decisions that are worth noting.\r\n\r\n* The API includes methods not only for details on Members of Congress but is more focused on their roll call votes over time.\r\n* The data goes back as far as any readily available sources go, this is a nice touch that makes it easier on people looking to do historical analysis of the behavior of Congress. (Data goes back to at least 1992 but as early as 1947 for Senate biographical data)\r\n* The `RESTful`_ API is easy to use and experiment with from a browser.  The four methods are easy to understand and don't require jumping through hoops.  They also use standard `HTTP error codes`_.\r\n* They have chosen to use Bioguide IDs as their primary keys, which means that they haven't introduced yet another identifier for members of congress. [*]_\r\n* The data returned is reasonably minimal throughout most of the API, you get back pretty much what you ask for without a ton of irrelevant information to sort through.\r\n\r\nThe Bad\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAs nice as the new API is from a technical perspective, there are a few problems that a would-be user might have.  These problems primarily stem from the `Terms of Use`_\r\n\r\n* 5000 requests per day limit seems a bit restrictive.  (it is prominently noted that this is subject to change, but no indication whether this change would likely be in the upwards or downwards direction)\r\n* Section 1.e.vi of the ToS states that you may not use the API for any service that competes with products or services offered by NYT.  This comes across as overly broad as one can imagine that a lot of this vote information would be useful for organizations that can in some way be considered 'in competition with the NY Times.' (such as local news organizations).\r\n* Section v of the attribution restrictions prohibits archiving of data for access by users \"at any future date after you have finished using the service\" which would prohibit something like building an application that used the NY Times as an initial source for votes but had no need to hit the Congress API regularly.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly\r\n========\r\n\r\nOk, not much is really ugly about this API, as I said it is quite simple and elegant.  At the time of this post however output is XML only and let's face it, XML is ugly.  (I have hopes that this will change as the Campaign Finance API is JSON, XML, or Serialized PHP with JSON by default.)\r\n\r\nThe New York Times should be applauded for their effort in creating both this and the Campaign Finance API, hopefully the future holds more of this from them and we look forward to seeing what they release next.  I hope that some of the more troublesome provisions can be revised or clarified as to make it beneficial to a wider audience.\r\n\r\n.. _RESTful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\r\n.. _`Congress API`: http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/introducing-the-congress-api/\r\n.. _`Campaign Finance API`: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/campaign_finance_api\r\n.. _`HTTP error codes`: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/reference/errors\r\n.. _`Terms of Use`: http://developer.nytimes.com/Api_terms_of_use\r\n\r\n..

We're clearly no longer the six-month pilot project we were chartered to be [31 months ago](http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2006/05/10/launching-sunlight-labs/). We're now a team of great developers using technology and the social web to open up the way our government in Washington operates and have been for quite some time. So we're long overdue for a gear-shift in the way we think about Sunlight Labs and how we work. There are three fundamental shifts in how we think about ourselves now vs. how the Labs was conceived.\r\n\r\nThe first shift is thinking of ourselves as a *permanent* institution, and that we are more than a \"mash-up lab.\" We now develop long-standing projects like [Capitol Words](http://www.capitolwords.org) and people depend on many of our [APIs](http://sunlightlabs.com/projects/) to run their websites. We think that's pretty cool. And we're just beginning. We have two more very large projects in the wings: The Sunlight Data Commons, and the [Pew Subsidy Project](http://subsidyscope.com).\r\n\r\nThe second shift is understanding that much of the software we write is useful to society and should be *open* so that anyone can use it to further government accountability and transparency. So, we're now publishing all of our source under various open source licenses, and as much of our data as bandwidth allows as CC-BY. We're beginning to make that transition [now](/projects/), and all new projects we create will be turned into Open Source projects. And to the best of our ability, all of the data our software produces will also be available in that form.\r\n\r\nThird, we now realize that many of the problems we face cannot be solved through traditional business methods. Whether it is [Name Standardization](http://wiki.sunlightlabs.com/index.php?title=Name_Standardization) or just finding new ways to [take in data](http://wiki.sunlightlabs.com/index.php?title=Data_Intake) there's a lot of work to be done, and it is probably too much for a small team of eight to do. We need to, instead, begin building a vessel that will enable outside developers to also enjoy the privilege of changing how their government works (and vice versa, how people work with their government). In doing so, we are inspired by our heroes at [Apache](http://www.apache.org) and [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) Foundation, who have blazed a path for open source developers worldwide.\r\n\r\n_In short: Sunlight Labs is an open source development team dedicated to making their government accountable._ And we want you to be a part of it. \r\n\r\nNow, to that end, I'd like to announce that with this redesign of the Labs, and a redesign of the Executive Branch of Government, Sunlight is launching its Apps for America contest. The award will be given to the best applications that use our community's data, tools and APIs to make their government good. [Check it out](/contest) and help us build some apps that shed light on our new Congress.\r\n\r\nWe're also opening up our first of hopefully many [email lists](http://groups.google.com/group/sunlightlabs) so that we can begin setting a course for new open source projects, and getting your help on our existing ones. And we'll need your ideas and proposals for new open source projects as well. \r\n\r\nWe hope you're as excited as we are by this new chapter of the Sunlight Labs story. \r\n\r\nOnward!\r\n\r\n--Clay\r\n", "date_published": "2008-12-19 10:10:28", "comment_count": 2, "slug": "labs2", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "public", "last_updated": "2008-12-18 17:00:38", "author": 5, "timestamp": "2008-12-18 17:00:38", "markup": "restructuredtext", "title": " Feed A Need: Donate Time to Sunlight for the Holidays", "excerpt": "reddit.com_ recently unveiled FeedANeed.org_, an charity drive designed to connect volunteers with worthy nonprofits in need of some form of assistance from the community.\r\n\r\nFeedANeed allows anyone to vote for worthy nonprofits and/or sign up to volunteer some chunk of their time to top vote-getting organizations.

James discusses our development philosophy and the drawbacks of CMS selection.", "content": "#### Pass223.com\r\n\r\nI recently worked on [Pass223.com](http://pass223.com \"Pass 223\"), a simple site that urges the Senate to pass a piece of legislation that requires the Senate to adhere to the same electronic financial disclosure rules in place for representatives and presidential candidates.\r\n\r\nPass223.com is similar to that of hundreds of related action sites: choose a legislator, call them, report results, repeat.\u00a0 I wrote the code, our esteemed creative director Kerry did the bulk of the design, and various others here at Sunlight helped to refine the concept and wording of the site and call script.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit surprising seeing how positive the [feedback](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/8/6/9501/66080/422/562998) has been for such a simple site.\u00a0 A number of people have been pointing to Pass223 as an example of how this type of thing should be done.  Most of that credit goes to the team that worked together to revise the awesomely straightforward script.\r\n\r\nThe other question that has come up is what content management system (CMS) Pass223 was done on and what legislative database it was built on top of.  This made me think about the other reason Pass223 was able to come together the way that it did, the tools used behind the scene.\r\n\r\n#### When all you have is a hammer...\r\n\r\nIt seems, especially in the nonprofit world where developers are sparse, that content management systems like [Drupal](http://drupal.org/ \"Drupal :(\") are considered the solution to every problem that arises.\u00a0 Because Content Management Systems can not possibly do everything that organizations want they are left with two options: attempt to mangle the CMS to do things it was never intended to do, or alternatively not get what they actually want.\u00a0 Because of the difficulty in dealing with the massive codebases of most CMSs, they often find themselves accepting both results.\u00a0 A great deal of time is therefore sunk into a project and in the end things still don't work quite how they were planned.\r\n\r\nThe supposed benefit of a CMS is the speed of deployment and ease of use, but as [Jeremy's recent post about LetOurCongressTweet](http://blog.sunlightlabs.com/2008/07/11/from-idea-to-production-in-six-hours/ \"LOCT post\") mentioned, we are able to rapidly create sites without the use of a CMS.\u00a0 And in reality, struggling to fit an innovative project or idea into the rigid structure of a CMS is not easy nor fast.\r\n\r\nA better use of the time and money spent maintaining and modifying complex CMS installations would be to spend that time learning and deploying sites in a framework such as [Django](http://djangoproject.com Django :)\") or [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/ \"Ruby on Rails\").\r\n\r\n#### Perfectionists with Deadlines\r\n\r\nDjango in particular was created to solve this problem.  Working with a bloated CMS forces you to make a decision between getting what you want and getting something fast, and more often than not you wind up with neither.  It is because of this that a team originally working at the [Lawrence Journal-World](http://www2.ljworld.com/) newspaper built Django to meet their needs as \"perfectionists with deadlines.\"\r\n\r\nFrameworks like Django provide all of the pieces of commonly used functionality, user registration, Object-Relational mappers to avoid dealing with the database directly, caching, and a ton more.  All of these pieces are given to you without any mandate that they must all be used, they are simply building blocks from which your particular project can choose to use or not.  A large site such as  [EarmarkWatch](http://earmarkwatch.org) may need complex user profiles, whereas it is possible to eschew all of the unneeded modules and build something as quick and simple as Pass223.com.\r\n\r\nUltimately, unless some CMS already provides exactly what you want, it is far easier to build a project from reusable components within a framework than to attempting to teach an old CMS a new trick.  One of the reasons that Pass223.com seems to impress people used to looking at the typical contact-your-legislator forms is because we had the flexibility to build what we wanted.", "date_published": "2008-08-07 18:04:44", "comment_count": 4, "slug": "cool-project-what-cms-did-you-guys-use", "tags": "django"}}, {"pk": 28, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "public", "last_updated": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "author": 1, "timestamp": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "markup": "markdown", "title": "From Idea to Production in Six Hours", "excerpt": "We recently decided to launch a petition-like site that uses Twitter as the organizing method; using one of the very technologies that are impacted by Congressional Web use restrictions.

That gave Kerry Mitchell, our fearless Creative Director, and I about six hours to get the site completed.\r\n\r\nSo how did it go?\r\n\r\n#### Twitter\r\n\r\nAs LOCT is a petition-like site, it is important to get a list of the people that are following the LOCT Twitter account. Twitter has a very nice API that makes it easy to pull information from the service. To get JSON list of people following your Twitter account, just send an HTTP GET request to <code>http://twitter.com/statuses/followers.json</code> using [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_authentication_scheme) with your username and password. You can also get a list of people following other user accounts from <code>http://twitter.com/statuses/followers/&lt;username&gt;.json</code>; no authentication necessary. We query Twitter for this information and cache it locally in a database.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to Twitter's recent performance issues, many of the nicest features have either been limited or disabled, making it almost impossible to use Twitter exclusively for LOCT. We needed to get a list of tweets that mentioned LOCT, but couldn't with the current performance restrictions in place. If only there was another service that provided this functionality.\r\n\r\n#### And there is!\r\n\r\n[Summize](http://summize.com/) rocks. Based right here in the greater Washington metropolitan area, Summize is tweet search service that has one of the few direct feeds into every tweet that is twittered. They also have an awesome API that makes it dead simple to search all tweets. <code>http://summize.com/search.json?q=%23loct08</code>. That is all you need to get search results in JSON. Just like the list of followers from Twitter, the results are cached locally for Maximum Performance<sup>TM</sup>.\r\n\r\n#### I would follow Django if it had a Twitter account\r\n\r\nAs with almost all projects created by [Sunlight Labs](http://sunlightlabs.com), [Let Our Congress Tweet](http://letourcongresstweet.org/) is writting using [Django](http://djangoproject.com), a [Python](http://python.org) Web development framework. I love Django. It simplifies development by providing [object-relational mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), templating, and other features in an unobtrusive way.\r\n\r\nDeveloping in Django is already quite rapid, but by reusing existing code we can develop at an unheard-of pace. Writing a reusable Django application is quite easy as it is nothing more than a standard Python module that can be used in any project.\r\n\r\n#### Feedinating the countryside\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago we released a new version of the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/) Web site. The old, infuriating Drupal installation was replaced with a slick Django application that was written in-house. One of the main features of the new site is feed aggregator that pulls in the recent blog posts from across the Sunlight-influenced transparency network. To accomplish this, we wrote _Feedinator_, a Django feed aggregator application that makes it easy to pull in feeds from multiple blogs and display them in different ways on a Web site.\r\n\r\nWe use Feedinator on Let Our Congress Tweet to pull in the feed of Tweets from the [LOTC08 twitter account](http://twitter.com/loct08/) and a [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) feed of Web sites that have mentioned LOCT. By writing Feedinator in a way that makes it easily reusable, we were able to start incorporating feeds into LOCT in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use Feedinator in your own project, you are in luck. We plan on releasing the code in the near future as well as the code for a few other Django applications and Python modules.\r\n\r\n#### Designers are useful\r\n\r\nWhile I was coding, Kerry took care of the design, CSS, and HTML. A few minutes of converting the HTML into Django templates and the site was up and running.\r\n\r\nSo that's it! After throwing in a few cron entries and some Apache configuration files, the site went live. We went from an idea to a production ready Web site in about six hours.

In 1857 16 clubs finally sent delegates to a convention to standardize the rules and standardize America&#8217;s Pastime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics\">Baseball statistics</a> have their own story. A fellow named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Chadwick_(writer)\">Henry Chadwick</a> was the first to start using statistics to judge a player&#8217;s performance. It was a few years after the sport was invented and formalized that this young journalist would give himself the goal of creating &#8220;numerical evidence as that would prove what players helped or hurt a team win.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took nearly 100 years for baseball statistics to make it to the common man and woman. It wasn&#8217;t until 1951 when a researcher named Hy Turkin published the Encyclopedia of Baseball that used a computer to compile statistics for the first time. It wasn&#8217;t until 1977 that decent, predictive and objective statistical methods called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics\">sabermetrics</a> were invented and distributed. Sabermetrics are the analytical methods that Theo Epstein used to break a curse and build a World Series winning Boston Red Sox. He even hired Sabermetrics&#8217; inventor to work for the Red Sox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took over a century to invent and distribute the objective performance measuring statistics we use today to evaluate baseball players. To tell whether or not Greg Maddux is a better pitcher than Pedro Martinez. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But though <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Continental_Congress\">Congress</a> has been around for nearly 234 years we still don&#8217;t have an objective way to tell whether or not my namesake, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay\">Henry Clay</a> was as effective of a speaker as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>. This isn&#8217;t to say we haven&#8217;t been making up our own statistics. We&#8217;ve been compiling subjective <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/scorecard/\">scorecards</a> for years. But we need a process of standardizing our statistics, publishing how they&#8217;re calculated, and we need to build a system for authenticating and delivering those results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took us over 100 years to get good baseball stats, but this isn&#8217;t to say that the data didn&#8217;t exist or wasn&#8217;t being recorded. The data was still there. Here&#8217;s the full stats on the <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1876.shtml\">1876 Chicago White Stockings</a>. People were watching, keeping score, logging the games and recording the data and even making their own statistics out of it. But it was the process of standardizing the statistics, publishing how they&#8217;re to be calculated and sharing the results that made these <em>subjective</em> metrics effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what metrics out there are effective in evaluating our legislators? Off the top of my head, here&#8217;s some elementary ones:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Attendance Percentage: The percent of time a member attends Congress when it is in session.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Vote percentage: The percentage of time a member has voted when they&#8217;ve had the opportunity to do so.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Sponsored Bills Per Term: The average number of bills sponsored and co-sponsored per term</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Sponsored Bills Passed Per Term: The average number of sponsored and co-sponsored bills passed per term</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Party percentage: The percentage of time the member votes with their political party</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Vote Victory Percentage: The percentage of time the member votes with a bill that passes.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just obvious building blocks of a much more sophisticated statistical system. All these statistics exist right now. Sunlight&#8217;s partner, <a href=\"http://opencongress.org\">Open Congress</a> and <a href=\"http://govtrack.us\">GovTrack.us</a> and many more track their congressional statistics in their own way as do many others. In order to do it right we need:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Standardization: We need to be calculating these things and naming these statistics the same way everywhere.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Comparison: Statistics are not relevant unless they&#8217;re in context. We need to be able to create a ranked 1-535 list for every statistic we standardize and create</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Adoption: They need to be adopted and as pervasive as RBIs and ERAs.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>More: We need more statistics made from the data that congress generates that provide &#8220;numerical evidence&#8221; about the effectiveness of congress. We need our own &#8220;sabermetrics&#8221; that objectively evaluate whether or not a Member of Congress is a effective at representing those that chose to elect them. The ones I've listed aren't even close to being accurate predictors.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>So let this be a post to start a discussion amongst the transparency community about how we can begin standardizing our own objective statistics, making them useful and centralized. Let&#8217;s start working together to invent new statistics for how our members can be evaluated. </p>\r\n", "date_published": "2008-06-30 02:49:54", "comment_count": 3, "slug": "call-to-action-learn-from-baseball", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 26, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "public", "last_updated": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "author": 6, "timestamp": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "markup": "none", "title": "Fun with CapitolWords", "excerpt": "We launched <a href=\"http://www.capitolwords.org\">Capitol Words</a> just a couple weeks ago and got a <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/19/daily-congressional.html\">really</a> <a href=\"http://news.oreilly.com/2008/06/requesting-a-mashup.html\">great</a> <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/72702/Capitol-Words-US-Congress-In-A-Word-A-Day\">reception</a> from the blogs.

Google reasonably imposes 15,000 calls-per-day limitation from same IP address on its service. So we might look into an alternate geocoding service so we can scale.

The ADK is a PHP framework that assists in the rapid development of REST web services. We've released the code under the LGPL license.</p>\r\n<h3>REST Framework</h3>\r\n<p>The core of the ADK is a framework for rapid web service development. You don't have to worry about receiving requests, building XML or JSON, or any other tedious code. All you need to do is write code to populate a RESTResponse object. We take it from there and generate XML or JSON from the object depending on the type of response the user requested.</p>\r\n<h3>Administration Application</h3>\r\n<p>So how do you manage all of the services you've written? We were nice enough to include a web based management application that can be used to manage users and service methods. To create a new method just fill in the method name and the name of the PHP class that implements the service. As long as your service class was dropped in the right folder, you'll be up and running with the method.</p>\r\n<h3>Key Management and Access Controls</h3>\r\n<p>The administration application can also be used to issue keys to users of the web service. You can place usage limits on each service method to limit the number of calls or amount of data that is transferred over a variable time period. You can also create methods that are accessible to a limited number of users. Of course if you prefer to have your service open to everyone then a simple configuration change will allow access to the services without a key.</p>\r\n<h3>Get it and contribute!</h3>\r\n<p>We hope you'll find the Sunlight ADK useful. <a href=\"http://sunlightadk.googlecode.com\">Get a copy now</a> and let us know what you think.

The site has great reviews of restaurants in the DC area and other related blog posts. Most of the review entries contain the address of the restaurant being reviewed. By itself this is of little value. We can read the post and see the address, but that's about it. Fortunately the site has an RSS feed.</p>\r\n<p>Let's take the RSS feed and run it through Yahoo's fantastic Pipes service. Pipes lets you take RSS and other feeds and execute various operations on the data. The site provides a dead simple visual editor that is used to apply the operatons and filters to the data. For example:</p>\r\n<p><img id=\"image20\" src=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/picture-1.png\" alt=\"DCFoodies.com in Yahoo Pipes\" /></p>\r\n<p>The pipe in the image above takes the DC Foodies RSS feed, geocodes any location data found in the posts, and filters out entries that do not contain geographic information. Pipes adds custom elements to the RSS feed that contain the latitude and longitude of the restaurants based on the addresses in the reviews. How cool is that? It gets even better.</p>\r\n<p>Among the various formats in which you can output your modified feed, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/\">KML</a> is specifically suited to syndication of geographic data. We can take the <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=GnHiiblc3BGoaGgXCR2yXQ&_render=kml\">URL of the KML output</a> and paste it into the search box of <a href=\"http://maps.google.com\">Google Maps</a>.

Since RSS is meant for syndication, two additional modules, elements belonging to a namespace, were used to add the information that was needed. The [xCal XML specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-royer-calsch-xcal-03 \"iCalendar in XML\") was used to add event data to the feed. xCal is an XML representation of the widely used iCalendar format. The format is fairly straighforward except for the organizer and attendee elements. The specification requires the value of these elements to be a URI rather than a string naming the individual. The URI can be any identifier, but is typically the email address of the individual. To include the name of the individual, a cn attribute must be added to the tag. The attendee element has a role attribute that describes the role in which the attendee will be serving. We've added a custom X-WITNESS role to identify witnesses that are testifying before a committee.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have a need to add multiple enclosures to the feed to represent different types of media: audio and video of events and documents related to the event. Since the RSS 2.0.9 spec is a bit unclear as to whether multiple enclosures are supported we decided to use Andreas Pedersen's [multiple enclosure extension](http://www.solitude.dk/archives/20050208-0045/ \"multiple enclosures in RSS\"). It's fairly straightforward and allows us to link to multiple types of related documents and media.\r\n\r\nYour feedback is welcome and desired! We'd like to make this sample feed as good as it can be to serve as an example of the Right Way to syndicate congressional schedules so any fixes or additions are quite appreciated.

I wonder though how many people actually use XML in web2.0 applications. After all, an XMLHttpRequest can return both responseXML and responseText. My bet is that text, including <strong>*J*</strong>SON, is used <em>far</em> more frequently than XML.\r\n\r\nIf one can do all the data processing server-side, send it back as HTML text to the browser, and the browser needs only to set some innerHTML, why bother with XML? Well, you respond, \"what if I have structured data and different pieces of data need to go to different parts of the page: a title here, an image URL over there, some content here. Then, innerHTML won't work. You need to send over data plus descriptive metadata so that the browser code knows what it is.\" While, true, I am still not convinced that XML is used that much. First, one can send different chunks of data in simple responseText. For instance, one might send back a comma- or pipe-delimited string. The javascript does a split on that character and so long as the correct ordering of those data pieces is preserved, the data can be separated and sent where it needs to go in the page. For more complex data, or for a more robust data transfer one can use JSON in the responseText.\r\n\r\nI've been developing <a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/api/\">an API for the labs</a> recently and each method can produce JSON and XML. It was really striking to me just how easy JSON is to consume in the browser. One gets all the benefits of metadata markup, but it is both very compact and extraordinarily simple to  reference those data items in Javascript. For instance, I send\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">{ name : \"Joe Doe\", title : \"VP, Engineering\", phone : \"13-456-7890\"}</div>\r\n<em>[<strong>Update</strong> : as the comment below points out, it should have read: { \"name\" : \"Joe Doe\", \"title\" : \"VP, Engineering\", \"phone\" : \"13-456-7890\"}] </em>\r\n\r\nin my responseText. In Javascript I need only do the following:\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">var obj = eval( '(' + XMHttpRequest.responseText + ')' );</div>\r\nand now I reference those individual data items as obj.name, obj.title and obj.phone. Could it be any simpler?\r\n\r\nWell, I thought that until I really started playing around with JSON and found that it has frustrating limits, ones that JSON.org does not highlight <strike>(dare I say lie?)</strike> in their documentation.\r\n\r\nTake the following code:\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">var j1 = \"{ data: \\\"ab\\\"}\";\r\nvar obj1 = eval( \"(\" + j1 + \")\" );\r\nalert(obj1.data);</div>\r\nwhat is alerted? \"ab\". Correct.\r\n\r\nHow about this:\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">var j1 = \"{ data: \\\"a\\nb\\\"}\";\r\nvar obj1 = eval( \"(\" + j1 + \")\" );\r\nalert(obj1.data);</div>\r\nWhat is alerted? \"a\\nb\". Correct? Wrong. It bails.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>JSON, or rather the Javascript parser, cannot handle \\n.\r\n</em></strong>\r\nThat's strange I swear that \\n is shown on JSON's wonderfully easy to understand documentation. Let's take a look:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"468\" height=\"357\" src=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/string.gif\" />\r\n\r\nYes, that's clear. JSON.org says that '\\n' is allowed in JSON. <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-504\">I was not the only one to find this \\n limitation</a>:\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">\"As for the second, regarding newline characters, http://www.json.org/ says they are valid JSON notation\"</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">Sort of, but it also states that \"It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999\", which clearly forbids them (par. 7.3)</div>\r\n<strike>So it is a lie then. JSON does not support \\n.</strike>\r\n\r\n<strike>Not only is this annoying but, in my mind, it does limit JSON usage.  I cannot  use it to transport arbitrary chunks of text.</strike>\r\n\r\n<hr /><strong>UPDATE</strong>: so at here Ajaxworld in NYC, I just asked Douglas Crockford, inventor of JSON, about this. So, it turns out that \\n needs to be escaped properly. Thus, the newline character should have been \\\\n\r\nThat is,\r\n<div style=\"padding: 10px; background: #ffcc66 none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial\">var j1 = \"{ data: \\\"a\\\\nb\\\"}\";\r\nvar obj1 = eval( \"(\" + j1 + \")\" );\r\nalert(obj1.data);</div>\r\ndoes work. JSON can handle arbitrary chunks of text so long as unicode characters are properly escaped. Whoops sorry about that.

In short, tools to create instant APIs, without programming \u2014 yes, really.\r\n\r\nTo be more concrete: suppose there is a website that you visit every day and you read the headlines. However, you prefer to read these stories in your favorite RSS reader but this website does not provide an RSS feed. You can use these tools to create such a feed yourself.\r\n\r\nOr, suppose you want to buy a second-hand iBook from Craigslist and are not in a rush; you would rather wait for the right deal. Well, you could manually check the listings everyday but you would rather be alerted if an iBook comes up for sale within a certain distance from home and under a certain price. To do this programmatically, you need to grab the listings for computer ads and then you can parse them to see in any match your criteria. You can use these tools to create an API for Craigslist computer ads, under a search query of \"iBook\", in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nAnything that is presented on a webpage, certainly a static webpage, is something that could be scraped. The problem is that scraping is not easy. Quality of HTML structure varies considerably. While some sites always use valid W3C XHTML, use CSS with lots of descriptive class names and sensible divs that divide different sections of the page, many do not. Do a view source of a random <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=154222679&MyToken=a044c8f0-98ad-403d-bbb9-08528fe02798\">myspace page</a> and you will see what I mean: it is a huge mess.\r\n\r\nSo, to scrape a page when it does not have a clear or consistent structure, or to scrape a page that requires a login (say, your AOL buddy list) is not at all easy. It can be done but it takes time and, moreover, because one is scraping who knows how long that scraper will last. The content provider makes a change in page structure and your scraper has to be reworked. Finally, one has to be a coder: you need to use tools such as curl or php to get the page contents, you may need tools such as html parsers to navigate the content, and you may need competency in regex to pull out precisely what you need from the page. Finally, you may actually need a server to create a page to display the final, desired content; and not everyone has such resources. (We will see below how one  can dispense with this latter requirement.) Any tools that provide instant APIs from arbitrary webpages, especially for non-progammers, has to be good news.\r\n\r\nTwo organizations in this space who demoed at Mashup Camp are <a href=\"http://www.dappit.com/\">Dapper</a> and <a href=\"http://openkapow.com/\">OpenKapow</a>. Now that I've had a chance to play around with these technologies, I want to take this opportunity here to review them, giving an unbiased critique.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dapper</strong>\r\n\r\nDapper is a US startup based in Israel founded by Eran Shir and Jon Aizen and is currently in open beta. While all services are free at the moment, large projects or commercial uses of Dapper may be charged in the future. However, if Dapper works as well as it is claimed then I can see many organizations making good use of Dapper and saving in development costs even in a fee-based structure. Why do I say this? What precisely is Dapper?\r\n\r\nDapper is a web-based tool and service for scraping, creating APIs from potentially any webpage and then generating output of that API in a variety of formats including HTML, XML, RSS and even Google Maps.\r\n\r\nOne starts by entering a URL and the webpage is displayed within Dapper. One can click through different pages and add each page to a \"basket\". Thus, one could add say pages 1, 2, 3, 4 of a blog. Dapper then analyzes these pages to work out the structure, say what is a static header and footer and what is dynamic content. One then gets to \"play\". That is, clicking on a story title (should) highlights all other story titles in the page. As such, one is confident that Dapper will grab the correct content from the page when you specify precisely what you want your API, or \"Dapp\", should do.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I had mixed success with this. While Dapper correctly identified the story titles for techcrunch.com and http://www.followthemoney.org/Newsroom/index.phtml, it did not do so on sunlightfoundation.com and it could not work out my intention of grabbing rows or columns on http://opensecrets.org/orgs/list.asp?order=A (but it could get the org titles). However, this is still a beta and Dapper certainly does work: there are hundreds of user-created Dapps that one can browse and use.\r\n\r\nAfter playing, one can then progress to creating the API proper: one clicks on a desired element, gives it a name and one can then define a group, e.g. specify that this story title, this author name and this number of diggs are all related as one unit. After that, one can preview the API, i.e. check what is pulled out by the API. If all is well, one is done. Then the real fun begins...\r\n\r\nDapper provides the API in a impressive variety of formats: XML, HTML, RSS, Alerts, iCalendar (transforms the output of a Dapp into an iCalendar which can be used in Google Calendar, Sunbird, iCal, and other programs), Google maps (places locations directly onto a map), Google gadgets, Netvibes, image loop, email, link to another Dapp, CSV, JSON, YAML, XSL, and fork it as another Dapp. This APIs are published and hosted at Dapper (hence one doesn't need their own server to provide an API). Dapper also allows one to define parameters for the API such as a {query} or {page}.\r\n\r\nSome of the resultant URLs are mess though. So, Dapp allows one to define a service that provides a nice clean URL. That is, instead of say http://www.dappit.com/RunDapp?dappName=sunlightlabs&v=1&thisparam=y&thatparam=z... one can instead provide users with say http://www.dappit.com/services/sunlightlabs.\r\n\r\nAnother nice feature is their AggregatorAid that allows one to pool Dapps into one single service. Thus, if one has a suite of different individual search Dapps (Google, digg, reddit, etc) one can provide a single query that will aggregate the results as a single API. The only restriction is that each that individual Dapp must have the same query parameter name (I hope that this is relaxed in later versions).\r\n\r\nFinally, Dapper provides secure, authenticated login into sites. Thus, if you want to scrape your AOL buddies or comments on your Facebook page, Dapper allows you to create an API without exposing your username or password.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dapper is a clean, slick instant API generator that has some very nice features: it is web-based, has a clean interface, and provides API output in the majority of formats that anyone would want. It is beta, it is not perfect, but then it is free. One really can get a basic API scraped from a page, published, and up and running in literally 5 minutes. This is why I say that I can see a valid business model here. Organizations, especially non-profits such as ourselves, can try Dapper first to create a given API, and only if it doesn't work then create the API from scratch or outsource which will certainly be more time consuming and expensive.\r\n\r\n<strong>OpenKapow</strong>\r\n\r\nOpen Kapow, also in beta, founded by  \t      Stefan Andreasen in Denmark, is part of the larger Kapow Techologies which appears to have a large range of corporate clients and a number offices on both sides of \"the pond\".\r\n\r\nOpenKapow has the same goal of instant APIs as Dapper but takes a different approach. For a start, while Dapper is web-based, OpenKapow requires a large \"RoboMaker\" download (100+ Mb) for windows or linux. [So, as a mac guy that cuts me out. If one takes a look around at any hacker or mashup conference you will find a sea of macs, and these are the guys who are most likely to do such mashups. While macs are UNIX underneath the linux version does not install on macs.]\r\nInstalling the RoboMaker on windows, one is presented with a sophisticated Java-based tool for mashups. As in Dapper, a webpage is loaded and displayed within the tool and one can select various elements of the page. RoboMaker has a nice DOM JTreeView that one can explore the structure of the page and one can click various elements and they will be highlighted and at the same time, the selected item is also shown in an HTML viewer. Together, the three panels provide a better understanding of the page structure than Dapper.\r\nOne the right are a series of controls for selecting tags based on name, type, conditions etc. There really are a very large number of features and controls that (I would image) provide a very granular approach to scraping. Therein, however, lies the problem.\r\n\r\nThere were so many controls, so many right click context menus, that it was not at all obvious for the newbie where to begin. I failed to select all the h1 tags of the page despite trying various combinations of select *.h1 etc. I saw OpenKapow in action at mashupcamp and I did see Stefan demo this creating an API for Google search. It looked very easy...if you know what you are doing. I really do believe that OpenKapow is a more sophisticated tool that probably can deal with edge cases that Dapper cannot. It is a tool for hackers/programmers who must invest some time into understanding the tool (and getting the thing downloaded and installed) but it is certainly not a quick and easy hacker tool. While both will generate APIs without true coding, I feel that Dapper is an quick-and-dirty, intuitive 90% solution while OpenKapow is a 90%+ tool for more serious projects.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have a short attention span but I have to admit that I gave up trying to get something basic working on OpenKapow. Besides, even if i did get it working, the output formats for OpenKapow are far more limited: (X)HTML, XML, REST, and RSS.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusions </strong>\r\n\r\nDapper especially allows one to try a quick hack. If that doesn't work then one could resort to writing it oneself or using a tool such as OpenKapow. OpenKapow looks as though it would be worth the effort to invest in learning all of the features if one was going to be doing lots of scraping and mashups, or in a corporate environment where one needed a very granular mashup that needed to work all the time. I think that <em>both</em> of these represent an exciting new era for mashups. They both represent programming-free tools for instant, shareable APIs. They both involve a reasonable GUI to select elements rather than needing to poke around the underlying HTML itself. As such, the bar for mashing up is significantly lowered.", "date_published": "2007-02-01 19:37:36", "comment_count": 0, "slug": "instant-apis-no-code-necessary-just-add-mouseclicks", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "public", "last_updated": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "markup": "none", "title": "Why offline is the new online", "excerpt": "The history of computing has some interesting trends.

First it was all about mainframes. To get anything computed you had to logon to some remote machine so large that if filled a room. Then came along the desktop; desktop apps were (and arguably still are) it. In the 1990's, however, things got pushed onto the web, web <em>sites</em> were the thing, and now with the rise of Ajax, web <em>apps</em> are becoming the new it. Applications such as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/writely/\">writely</a> (now \"google docs\") or <a href=\"http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/tour1.html\">google spreadsheets</a> that have the look, feel and responsiveness of traditional desktop applications.  I want to predict the next segment of this zig-zag computing trend: offline web apps on your desktop.\r\n\r\nIn the last couple of months there have been some very interesting developments. Adobe have staked their claim in this area with the announcement of <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo\">Apollo</a>, Mozilla is already in this arena with <a href=\"http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner\">xulrunner</a>, and recently <a href=\"http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/\">dojo</a> announced a forthcoming offline library. Before we get into the specifics though, I want to dig a little deeper into some background and discuss the influence of widgets.\r\n\r\nWidgets are really hot now, small focussed applications that serve one or two useful purposes: show the local weather, a simple RSS reader, show what is playing on iTunes etc. The problem is that they are tied to particular browser\u2014<a href=\"http://widgets.opera.com/\">opera widgets</a> only work for the opera browser\u2014or tied to a particular operating system\u2014apple's <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/\">dashboard widgets</a> only work on a mac\u2014or they must be served through a third party host (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.widgetbox.com/\">widgetbox</a>). This sucks for all involved: developers always want to write once, run anywhere but instead they have to write and maintain slightly different versions for lots of different platforms. Users don't want to search through some complicated table to work out which one they need to download. What we all want is a universal \"click to download and install\" widget, that does what it says, and that does what it says in the same way on all platforms with the same code. We want a simple app that will float on the window, do its thing.\r\n\r\nDesktop app are tied to native libraries for good reason: performance. Fast, efficient Cocoa apps for mac, .net for for windows etc. While Java claims to be universal, it is very slow to launch, there are still UI inconsistencies across platforms, and it can never reach the same degree of performance as native apps for compute-intense apps such as rendering and video CODECs. Widgets are different however. Their functions are typically so simple that it makes no difference. To grab and display the latest blog post entry's title from your favorite blog is hardly going to stress the CPU. So, they can be written in universal language such as HTML+CSS+JS.\r\nThe stupid thing is that widgets are all written in the same language: HTML+CSS+JS. Opera widgets and Apple's dashboard widgets are essentially the same under the hood but they just cannot run on each other platforms. Within 6 months we are, however, going to see more universal widgets and desktop apps written in web technology.\r\nAdobe is starting to promote its forthcoming Apollo platform. Apollo will provide libraries for offline storage, will have the ability to read and write to the desktop's file system (which is difficult to achieve in true web apps because of the built in security model), and will have libraries for flash, HTML and PDFs. So to make sure we are clear here: you will be able to write a web app in HTML and have it run universally on all platforms: windows, mac and linux, and further, the HTML can be rendered through the flash viewer so that it is virtually guaranteed to look and operate exactly the same on all of those platforms. As a developer, one can write once, make it generally available for download as an .air file, have it work on all platforms. Not only that but Apollo apps can continuously check for connectivity: you shut down your computer because you are getting onto a plane, no problem. After take off, you open it up and continue as before. Moreover, all of these offline activities or transactions are stacked up locally and processed online as soon as connectivity is restored. You can continue to work offline and it will seamlessly sync to online when it can. Oh, and did I say all of this will be free? [They will make their money through selling more Adobe Flex licenses to developers.] Apollo will be available later this year but the main feature they need to fix is distribution. Currently, one has to download an Apollo runtime and an apollo installer. This is not likely to engender uptake by the mainstream Joe Doe end user. However, unsurprisingly, they do have plans to distribute through the flash player so the back end installation will be seamless.\r\n\r\nMozilla already in this space through xulrunner. So, \"xulrunner --install -app gmail\" is all that is needed to create a desktop app for gmail. This will provide a local executable that will launch a window to gmail. This can be running independently of any browser. This is from Mozilla so of courser there are <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> libraries running behind the scenes but the point is that I can have a persistent desktop application running up in say my top right corner of my screen, always there, always keeping me informed of whatever I want to keep informed about, without me having to have firefox or any other browser running and have that window or tab showing. This too will allow developers to write desktop applications in HTML+CSS+JS that run offline. Given the number of developers who know these technologies, this could be a huge boon for desktop app innovation. Again, this allows a write once run anywhere [but with less guarantees about consistent look and feel] and has local SQLlite database for local storage.\r\nDojo too is likely to be another important player. They are working on an <a href=\"http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/\">offline toolkit</a>, a \"small, cross-platform, generic       download that enables web applications to work offline.\" It will be cross platform, cross-browser, connectivity detecting, secure, with local storage. Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nLet me stress that one is not going to be able to take an existing complex, server-side PHP+MySQL web application, type a single command and have it instantly available as a desktop application.

Now one can draw and animate curves in DHTML.\r\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, flash is a great innovative, product (sometimes abused where the whole website is flash and you cannot link to anything) has a very thin client, and most importantly looks and feels the same on different browsers (without all those frustrating conditional CSS IE hacks). For this reason it will hold a strong position for a while to come yet, but I do feel that we will continue to see increasing innovation in Ajax libraries and a convergence of DHTML websites to have a flash-like look and feel.", "date_published": "2007-01-08 17:54:12", "comment_count": 0, "slug": "the-convergence-of-ajax-and-flash", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "draft", "last_updated": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-12-04 17:56:22", "markup": "none", "title": "Cool.

Steve Nelson is displaying information on members of Congress inside Second Life (<a href=\"http://slurl.com/secondlife/Capitol%20Hill%201/173/17/30/\">SLurl location</a>) using the Sunlight Labs's still-in-beta API (Application Programming Interface).\r\nSteve is entering his \"U.S. House of Representatives Info Center\" in <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/mashup\">Sunlight's first Web 2.0 Mash-Up contest</a> (deadline April 15). I'm blogging it  because it so wonderfully illustrates the phrase Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s CEO Jonathan Schwartz used to explain why Sun, a publically traded Fortune 500 company, decided to embraced open source: \"Openness is an accelerant.\"  <img src=\"/files/slch-new-med.jpg\" />  <em>Openness is an accelerant.</em> None of us in the Labs know the first thing about programming Second Life. Yet, because we have an open web service API for certain data on Congressional Representatives at <a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/api/\">SunlightlLabs.com/API</a>, someone else could.  As the screen shot shows, Second Life members approach Steve's Info Center and then type their zip code into chat. Steve  programmed his Info Center to go over the web to SunlightLabs's API and fetch back a photo of the appropriate representative and links to related pages on different accountability web sites.\r\nOur openness accelerated Steve's bringing data we compiled to new users in a new context with new tools. Regardless of your opinion of 3D worlds, <em>how cool is that?</em>  To get a bit more geeky, two types of openness enable Steve's Info Center Mash-Up: 1) the openness of web service APIs and 2) the openness Second Life provides to its \"citizens\" to create virtual objects.\r\nSunlight Labs rockstar Dr. Carl Anderson created a web service API to a database that cross references zip codes with congressional districts with the IDs different web sites use to use publish dynamic content on members of Congress from their particular databases. Having an API means other developers -- like Steve Nelson -- can access the cross-referencing we've already done directly from their computer programs thereby accelerating their ability to make new applications with this data. Our API open goodness is then paired with the openness of Second Life's platform that allows members to create and populate its virtual world with structures and objects much the same way AOL's members created and populated AOL with community bulletin boards and chat rooms.\r\nSteve created his interactive congressional display within SL's Capitol Hill, a place for political information he co-created with others. SL's openness accelerates its development by its members.  (To experience a different but equally cool Web 2.0 mash-up of congressional data in your standard browser, see <a href=\"http://www.tetonpost.com/citycon\">www.tetonpost.com/citycon</a>.)  If you are citizen of Second Life, <a href=\"http://slurl.com/secondlife/Capitol%20Hill%201/173/17/30/\">visit Steve's Info Center</a>. If you are a developer -- Second Life or Web 2.0 -- use openness as an accelerant to your own ideas for mashing-up congressional information and enter our <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/mashup\">Mash Up Contest</a> before the April 15, 2007 deadline for chance to win $2,000.

(Yes, it probably is, for those not wanting to read the entire post.)\r\n\r\nMost of the data visualizations I have seen lately have the following in common:\r\n* uses machine found data or data received from another party\r\n* large sample set\r\n* frequently includes time\r\n* data extracted from other occurring activities\r\n* trends rather than search\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the datasets which non-profits in the government oversight and money and politics arena, I see the following in common:\r\n* human entered data or data requiring human standardization\r\n* small to medium sample sets\r\n* linear aggregations\r\n* duration aggregation but little trend analysis\r\n* data created specifically for searching\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is the most significant determinant of creating data visualizations is the choice of whether to work with machine found data or to work with human entered data. I believe the affordances and mindset of working with machine found data tends to lead toward meaningful data visualizations while working with human entered data tends lead away from data visualization and toward anecdotal ___\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this for a while, but two visualizations on the Dow Jones Insight blog (via O'Reilly Blog) set me to writing.  Both visualizations count words in documents to make pretty pictures. Or to say it more technically: Both visualizations use machine-based textual analysis to extract information for statistical comparisons. \r\n\r\nthat use textual analysis of media coverage to generate a statistical analysis that can be visualized. In other words, Dow Jones counts words to make pretty pictures. \r\n\r\nCounting words is a great way to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. The first visualizes candidate speeches. The second visualizes press sentiment toward candidates. Both are examples of what I would describe as machine found data. Machine found data is structured data generated by a computer from existing digital content. Read this little tidbit from the Down Jones post:\r\n\r\n\"The system considered 65,374 press documents and found 26,435 of them to contain either favorable or unfavorable language dominating in reference to a candidate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "date_published": null, "comment_count": 0, "slug": "", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 35, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "draft", "last_updated": "2009-01-09 18:02:19", "author": 3, "timestamp": "2009-01-09 18:02:19", "markup": "none", "title": "Weekly Lab Report Wrap-Up", "excerpt": "Test test", "content": "<u>GENERAL NEWS</u>\r\n\r\n<b>Faster Memcache!

They announced that every document that the transition team received in a meeting where there was three or more attendees would be posted online.\r\n\r\nLet me be clear: that was an *awesome* step and the change.gov team should be commended for taking it.\r\n\r\nThat being said it looks like the change.gov team is learning as they go.  I respect that: being the first people to try this stuff means you've got to. The process has been less than perfect, and I hope what they're learning as a community is that being transparent requires a lot of work, and often opens the door to a lot more requests. I cannot imagine the time and expense they've occurred building such a project for the American people. Here's some things I've noticed.\r\n\r\nAs of today:\r\n1.  Weeks of documents are missing\r\n2.  When you click on \"page 2\" of the [http://change.gov/open_government/yourseatatthetable](main page) you receive an error; [http://change.gov/S=5ca7c563bed3878feb30bbec035a51e83fd3a690/open_government/yourseatatthetable/P10/](The page you requested is not available right now.)\r\n3. Several of the documents on the front page have dates in the future. \r\n4. You can only search once every 15 seconds. \r\n\r\nI'm *certain* that there's a strong amount of effort being put on this by the administration and they're taking it very seriously, but I suspect that it will never be good enough. Transparency's a big job!\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting though, is that there's probably a much easier solution for them that would require a lot less work: \r\n\r\n1. Standardize the names of the documents, and put them on an FTP server or an index-free http page somewhere \r\n2. update that FTP server when documents come in and are sanitized. \r\n3. write a blog post telling us it is there. In the blog post, say \"people are encouraged to build their own search interfaces and browsing interfaces to the data as they see fit\" \r\n\r\nThe result? Instead of having a functionally broken [http://change.gov/open_government/yourseatatthetable](page) you'll likely have the [http://sunlightlabs.com](Sunlight Labs) scrambling to build an interface, [http://watchdog.net](Watchdog.net) parsing the data and incorporating it, and media organizations like the New York Times working on their own too. Plus, you'd earn praise from the tech community for being participatory and more open.\r\n\r\nThe point being: This transparency business gets really tough if you make it tough, but if you're looking for the easy way out, there's likely a much simpler solution. And often the simpler ones end up being more sophisticated and impressive anyhow.\r\n\r\n", "date_published": null, "comment_count": 0, "slug": "seat_at_the_table", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 51, "model": "blogdor.post", "fields": {"status": "draft", "last_updated": "2009-02-02 10:36:34", "author": 6, "timestamp": "2009-02-02 10:36:34", "markup": "markdown", "title": "Legislative Transparency", "excerpt": "", "content": "We work hard to make congressional data more transparent and available to the world, and often times we forget how good we've got it.
